# CANDRAJIWA INDONESIA (ENGLISH VERSION)

## INTRODUCTION

I take this opportunity to express my gratitude and appreciation to those who have made it possible for me to reach this milestone in my life.

First and foremost, I extend my respect, love, and thanks to R. Soenarto Mertowardoyo, to my late father, and to R. Trihardono Soemodihardjo, who have shown me the path to courageously pursue the goals I consider to be the purpose of life.

Furthermore, I am deeply indebted to my mentor, Professor R. Slamet Iman Santoso, Head of the Department of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Mental Health at the Medical College in Jakarta, who has always been willing to accompany me on my journey towards psychiatry.

At the same time, I mention in the same breath my teacher, Dr. E.A.D.E. Carp, Professor of Psychiatry at Leiden University and head of the "Jelgersma" clinic. Years ago, when I was still in Indonesia, he encouraged me from afar to further explore research on the Indonesian people and later graciously guided me in his clinic. The atmosphere of psychological guidance I received from him allowed me to complete this work in the shortest possible time. The following analogy, which will surely capture the attention of certain individuals, depicts the deep emotional connection: if this work were a baby, then Professor Carp would be its midwife.

To my fellow assistants and colleagues at the "Jelgersma" clinic, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for the pleasant cooperation during my time in Nederland. I would like to give special mention to Ms. Th.M.A. van Lith, who patiently assisted me with the technical execution of this dissertation. Her unwavering support has been invaluable.


## CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION

Every culture possesses its own "candramanusia" (1), which serves as a guiding principle for self-development and self-preservation in this world and the hereafter. This candramanusia does not always need to be fully known consciously. Depending on the level of development and cultural needs, certain aspects of the candramanusia are formulated clearly at specific times.

In the history of Indonesia, there have undoubtedly been numerous candramanusia, and the same holds true in the present. Each culture that comes from outside brings its own candramanusia and candradunia (worldview) and influences the existing candramanusia. This influence is undoubtedly reciprocal.

Thus, with the arrival of the Hindu people, the Hindu candramanusia and candradunia, depicted in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, were also imported. With the advent of Buddhism, the Buddhist candramanusia and candradunia also entered. Later, Islam and Christianity came. All of these candramanusia and candradunia mix and blend with the original (autochthonous) candramanusia.

If viewed comprehensively, Indonesia consists of regions that still uphold the original animistic candramanusia and candradunia, while in other regions, there are candramanusia and candradunia influenced by Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, in either pure form or with some modifications. In wayang stories, we often encounter inserted candramanusia and candradunia that do not follow the continuity of the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

These smuggled stories are complete narratives that utilize the popularity of wayang in Javanese culture to reach a wider audience. Their content shows anti-propaganda against Hindu candramanusia and candradunia. I mention here the stories of Dewa Ruci, Arjuna Wiwaha, Makuta Rama, and Dipaningrat.

In Javanese literature of past centuries, there were candramanusia depicted with varying levels of detail, such as in the works of Ronggowarsito and Wiryokusuno (2).

The classical wayang performance as a whole, with its sequential scenes bound by fixed rules, also reveals a candramanusia and candradunia (3) that might have existed in its initial form before the arrival of Hindu influences.

In recent times, notable studies and lectures were given by the late Dr. Radjiman Wedyaningrat, whom I personally know. Especially the wayang story "Dewa Ruci," which narrates the journey of the hero Bima in search of the Water of Life, captivated this multi-talented individual who dedicated all his strength during the struggle for independence, despite his advanced age and physical limitations.

This dissertation is based on books, manuscripts, letters, as well as discussions and interactions with individuals who seek meaning and purpose in life and strive to achieve it.

Thus, three individuals serve as sources for this dissertation: R. Soenarto Mertowardoyo, R. T. Hardjoprakoso (deceased in 1942), and R. Trihardono Soemodihardjo. The first person mentioned is the central figure.

With various sources of candramanusia mentioned above, it is reasonable to conclude that R. Soenarto formulated his candramanusia and candradunia based on existing data, just as any scientist would do.

R. Soenarto was familiar with the existing sources of knowledge to the same extent as any ordinary employee. He did not have more or less knowledge than others in general. However, his candramanusia and candradunia were obtained through a different manner, and he did not intentionally attempt to formulate a systematic candramanusia and candradunia. According to him, he received them through inspiration (ilham) while earnestly seeking the true purpose of life with all his heart and soul.

This phenomenon of inspiration, which cannot be investigated through experimental methods by reason alone, yet remains a genuine psychological reality for humans, will be highlighted and examined as it occurred. Not everything psychological is tangible, and it lies beyond the reach of rational comprehension.

Father Walder wrote:

>"Die religiöse Funktion ist eine Grundgegebenheit des Menschen, Offenbarung ist für ihn (Jung) kein einmaliges Ereignis, sondern kann immer wieder stattfinden. Die Wahrnehmungsfunktion für die archetypische Vorstellungen ist die irrationale (introvertierte) Intuition, die in Beziehung gesetzt werden kann zur religiösen Funktion" (4).

"The religious function is a fundamental aspect of human nature; revelation, for Jung, is not a singular event but can occur repeatedly. The perceptual function for archetypal ideas is the irrational (introverted) intuition, which can be related to the religious function." (4)

> Wenn man jedoch die innere Entwicklung von Jungs Werk überblickt, so kann man feststellen, dass immer deutlicher neben den wissenschaftlich-skeptischen, phänomenologischen Gesichtspunkten eine Haltung tritt, die auch über den philosophisch-kritischen Gesichtspunkt hinausgeht und einen ausgesprochen metaphysisch-religiösen Standort verrät. Der Grund für das Hervortreten des metaphysisch-religiösen Gesichtspunktes ist gegeben in der wachsenden Bedeutung, die in Jungs Forschertätigkeit dem Problem der Beziehung des Menschen zur Sphäre des Göttlichen, des Numinosen, zukommt. Jung muss einsehen, dass ein nur phänomenologisch-empirischer und letzte Endes unverbindlicher Standort dem Numinosen gegenüber nicht gerecht wird.

> Es liegt zutiefst in der Natur des Numinosen, dass es den Menschen zur metaphysisch-religiösen und vor allen Dingen auch zur ethischen Stellungnahme zwingt" (5).

However, when one surveys the inner development of Jung's work, one can observe that alongside the scientifically skeptical and phenomenological perspectives, there emerges a stance that goes beyond the philosophical-critical standpoint and reveals a distinctly metaphysical and religious orientation. The reason for the emergence of the metaphysical-religious perspective lies in the growing significance Jung attributes to the problem of the relationship between humans and the sphere of the Divine, the Numinous. Jung must recognize that a purely phenomenological-empirical and ultimately non-committal standpoint does not do justice to the Numinous.

It is deeply inherent in the nature of the Numinous that it compels humans to adopt a metaphysical-religious and, above all, an ethical stance. (5)

> Carp menulis: "Het Ik kan slechts ten onder gaan in het besef van de onmogelijkheid het transcendente te leren kennen. En op de weg naar de ondergang kan het Ik door openbaring kennis verkrijgen van waarheden, welke geloofwaarheden worden genoemd" (6).

Carp writes: "The ego can only perish in the realization of the impossibility of knowing the transcendent. And on the way to perishing, the ego can acquire knowledge of truths through revelation, which are called beliefs." (6)

There is no candramanusia in the history of Indonesia or its parts that provides a more comprehensive and profound depiction than the one presented by R. Soenarto.

The selection of Soenarto's candramanusia and candradunia is based on the following main considerations

1. This candramanusia contains the most comprehensive material for a complete and profound candramanusia and candradunia derived from a single source.

2. This candramanusia points out the genuine differences between candramanusia aimed at self-development (the Self) and candramanusia directed towards external powers.

3. This candramanusia indicates the greatest common divisor of all candramanusia and candradunia existing in Indonesia.

4. This candramanusia points to the essence of human existence, which contains the potential for merging into the Absolute-transcendent.

5. From its essence, a psychotherapy can be developed.

6. This candramanusia can shine brilliantly when compared to the candramanusia and candradunia creations of Freud, Adler, and Jung.

7. This candramanusia reveals the potentials within human beings that can have theoretical and practical significance in the future.

"All excavated treasure in the world remain worthless as long as the treasure-digger has not dug up the own self. Contemplating a human being is contemplating oneself, and no psychotherapy, which does not advantage the own self, is possible. The human contemplation referred to leads to the design of personality of being a human creature, characterized by his existentialism, i.e. his freedom to decide himself and his transcendent i.e. his involvement in the absolute," (7).

The event began on February 14, 1932, when R. Soenarto suddenly heard a Voice (8) from within himself, from the depth of his being, providing the answers he was seeking. The Voice answered his question about what is Real and what is the True Science. He did not hear the Voice with his physical ears, but it was as if there was a change in his state of consciousness, and in this altered state of consciousness, he was inspired to ask, "What is the Path that leads to the Real?"

R. Soenarto asked in his heart, "Who could be speaking?" and immediately received another inspiration that Life is One and exists within every human being, manifesting itself in the deepest core of human heart and soul. Life is not passive towards humans, as long as humans themselves are not passive towards Life (9). Life is our Advisor and Leader, and the point of contact of Life within human beings is the deepest consciousness (Rahsa Jati of a human). The Voice identified itself as Suksma Sejati, the True Guru, Guide, and True Model for humanity, the Eternal Impersonal (Onpersoonlijk) Emissary of Suksma Kawekas, the Supreme Life.

Subsequently, in the same manner, R. Soenarto was informed of the names R.T. Hardjoprakoso and R. Soemodihardjo, who were designated as his assistants in the future.

R.Soenarto did not personally know them. He only knew the name of R.T. Hardjoprakoso. R.Soenarto was hesitant to approach him because he was unsure of how others would perceive his experiences. Therefore, he waited and kept his experiences secret. Initially, he did not dare to discuss them with anyone.

By a "coincidence," the three men eventually met. As it turned out, the other two men had been seeking the Real as well. They were receptive to R.Soenarto's experiences and welcomed them. Since then, inspirations started coming more frequently. Not only R.Soenarto but the other two men also had their own experiences of inspirations.

Certainly, these inspirations could only be experienced personally by the individuals. These events occurred unexpectedly, not bound by time and place. Moreover, they could not be intentionally induced. During the reception of inspirations, their consciousness remained functioning.



> "Intuition wird nicht gemacht, man hat einen Finfall, der yon selbst entstanden ist" (10).

"Intuition cannot be made, one has an insight that arises from within oneself." (10)

One day, R.Soenarto received an inspiration that these intuitions or insights should be documented, and the other two men were appointed as scribes to record everything. R.Soenarto would function as the voice corrector, ensuring that the insights could be captured by the other two men.

This event, where the arrival of inspiration was announced in advance, allowing the individuals involved to prepare themselves, was an exception.

During these moments, R.Soenarto's psychological state was one of full consciousness, fully aware of what was being spoken. What he uttered was recorded completely and consciously in his own soul and stored in his memory. At such times, his own thoughts ceased. There were no mental images, doubts, or considerations about what should be said. His words flowed continuously like a river until the end. He felt no external force or limited foreign body within him. It was as if an original source emerged from the depths of his soul, which his body's organs faithfully translated into a language understandable by the scribes. In this way, seven chapters were recorded, collectively forming a book titled "SASANGKA JATI," which became the main source of this dissertation.

This dissertation consists of two parts. The first part comprises chapters where candramanusia and candradunia in Indonesia are presented in their most authentic form. To obtain the most accurate depiction of this original work, certain chapters are provided in a free translation.

The second part includes chapters where candramanusia and candradunia are depicted using the terminologies employed by Freud, Adler, and Jung.

The final chapter discusses a comparative analysis, examining the position of the self ("sang Aku") in the systems of Freud, Adler, and Jung in comparison to its place within the context of candramanusia in Indonesia.



ADDITIONAL NOTES:

1. The term "candramanusia" is used interchangeably with "candrajiwa." "Candramanusia" is a translation of the term "mensbeeld," which is used in the field of anthropology and refers to "a view of humans that serves as a guide to life, whether conscious or unconscious." On the other hand, the term "candrajiwa" is used in a psychological context and pertains to "the anatomical and physiological structure of humans as spiritual beings." Furthermore, the terms "werebeeld" and "idealbeeld" are respectively translated as "candradunia" and "candraideal."

2. Additionally, there are references to the works of Wiryokoesoemo and Ronggowarsito. Wiryokoesoemo presents his work titled "Serat 'Wedatama'," dedicated to Sri Paduka Mangkunegara IV and published in 1937 by the Publisher and Bookstore "De Bliksem" in Surakarta. Meanwhile, Ronggowarsito published his work titled "Serat Wirid Hidayat Jati" in 1924, with its publication entrusted to Tan Khoen Swie in Kediri.

5. Similarly, on page 4, "However, if one thoroughly examines the development of Jung's psyche, it can be established that alongside the scientific-skeptical-phenomenological standpoint, there is always an increasingly clear stance that surpasses the philosophical-critical standpoint and reveals a philosophical-religious standpoint. The basis for the emergence of this metaphysical-religious standpoint lies in the increasing significance given to the issue of the relationship between human beings and the Divine, the Divine nature, in Jung's research activities. Jung certainly realized that a disrespectful attitude towards the Divine is only based on the final points (standpoints) of empirical-phenomenological perspectives and cannot be justified. It is the fundamental nature of the Divine to compel individuals towards a metaphysical-religious and particularly ethical stance."

## Chapter II: Structural Aspects

"If we create a schema as depicted in this chapter (refer to Schema I) regarding the relationship of humans with the external world and the intrapsychic relationships of humans, we obtain a comprehensive picture of candramanusia as a visual guide to understanding the anatomy and physiology of humans as spiritual beings. Furthermore, this schema serves as a visual space to easily follow and comprehend the objectives to be achieved by Indonesian candramanusia.

(The comprehensive depiction of the anatomy and physiology of humans as spiritual beings mentioned above will henceforth be referred to as candrajiwa, to distinguish it from the term candramanusia in the sense of 'a view of humans that serves as a guide to life, whether conscious or unconscious.' Please also refer to Additional Note Number 1, Chapter I, by the Translator)."

In discussing the candrajiwa of Indonesia and the meanings it holds, we must consider specific fundamental issues, namely:

a) The nature of humans, both in terms of their structural and functional aspects.
b) The nature of the external world.
c) Sensory communication and psychological communication between humans and the external world.
d) Spiritual communication between humans and the transcendental.

These four aspects are examined based on the premise that humans are spiritual beings striving for the manifestation of the Transcendent Absolute within themselves.

Both humans and the external world are dynamic, and within humans lies the freedom to decide and choose. If one chooses a candraideal, it contains two possibilities: either the ideal can be achieved, or it may not be achieved due to being hindered or lost along divergent paths.

Therefore, in this candrajiwa of Indonesia, a path is also referred to as a guide in the challenging process of human development. The Indonesian candra-ideal is nothing but the character that emerges from within the individual. This character has always been present from the beginning, though in most individuals, it remains latent or underdeveloped. There is a continuity of human personality development from the general level to the candra-ideal level, which represents the ultimate stage of human development.

Throughout this development, nothing from the external world is incorporated or impressed upon the human personality. No foreign energies are introduced into the individual; everything belongs to the individual himself. If there are foreign energies that infiltrate and operate within us, then we are on the wrong path. This is the essential difference between R. Soenarto's Indonesian candramanusia and other specific candras found in Indonesia.

The teaching of this Indonesian candramanusia and candradunia is to attain the candra-ideal in our present life.


According to this teaching, humans consist of an immaterial principle which is their essence and a material envelope (1). This immaterial principle is not localized in any specific part or bound to any particular organ, but it is also referred to as the point of connection with its material envelope, which is in the area near the heart (2). The place where we experience our deepest and most refined feelings indicates the gateway to enter into this immaterial realm.

The starting point of Indonesian candrajiwa and candradunia is the True Life, the source of all life and the source of all material existence (3). This True Life is one and eternal, immaterial, permeating, penetrating, and encompassing everything. It transcends space and time. True Life has no beginning and no end. Essentially, this True Life manifests in three aspects.

The first and highest aspect is the absolute and static Life, known as Suksma Kawekas. The second aspect is the dynamic Life, where activities are born from the static one, known as Suksma Sejati. The third aspect is the Holy Spirit, the true soul of humans, which can be considered as the light or spark of the Suksma Kawekas. The one Life that manifests in three aspects is called TRIPURUSA(4).

If Suksma Kawekas represents the will, then Suksma Sejati is the holder of planning and wisdom, and the Holy Spirit has the power of execution (5). Suksma Kawekas possesses absolute power, being its owner. The absolute power of Suksma Sejati is reduced by will, which is why Suksma Sejati is also referred to as the non-personal (onpersoonlijk) delegate of Suksma Kawekas. The Holy Spirit, as a spark of Suksma Kawekas, is also considered a servant of Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati and receives the transfer of power from Suksma Sejati. It is reduced in its competence for planning and wisdom in carrying out the power of execution, led and assisted by Suksma Sejati. Therefore, Suksma Sejati is also called the True Guru, True Guide, or True Leader, the Word, and the Leader (6).

As the dynamic aspect, Suksma Sejati creates four basic elements: atmosphere, fire, water, and earth. These four elements interact with each other and, guided by a plan, give rise to the universe. Thus, in the world, there are humans, animals, plants, and gods. The human body consists of four elements, animals: three (atmosphere, fire, and earth), plants: two (fire and earth), and gods: one element, which is the element of fire (7).

The essence within humans is the Holy Spirit, with its absolute connection within Tripurusa, whereas in animals, the essence is only the Holy Spirit without an absolute connection within Tripurusa. Plants and gods do not have the Holy Spirit as their essence. The life force of plants is derived from their own elements, namely water and earth (8).

Regarding the gods, please refer to the chapter "On the Gods." Everything that is elemental in various forms, movements, and metamorphoses, and everything that cannot be separated from the elements, is considered as the garment of Life (9).

If one form is destroyed, the elemental components return to their original state, only to form other manifestations later. This continuous process of development and destruction, creation and annihilation, birth and death, growth and decline of forms and appearances will continue as long as the Will of Suksma Kawekas remains in effect, allowing all of this to persist (10).

Each of the four elements has its own potential, which manifests itself in the human body as an activity or impulse. Thus, there are four different life forces or impulses.

The impulse of the element of "suasana" is directed towards humanity, society, and the suprasocial, expressing love and compassion towards fellow beings. This impulse is named 'mutmainah'. The element of fire contains the impulse we call anger, which manifests itself in a temperament prone to quick anger, strong willpower, and determination in accomplishing tasks. The element of water gives rise to the impulse of desire and longing, love, and attraction towards beauty. This impulse is called 'sufiah'. "Lauwamah" is the impulse of the earth, characterized by egoism, self-preservation, and reluctance to initiate action. It manifests in traits of laziness, greed, seeking pleasure, self-satisfaction, egoism, and sensual desires. However, this impulse also has positive aspects, especially when it is subordinated to and utilized for "mutmainah," social, and suprasocial impulses. In such cases, "lauwamah" manifests in the form of physical strength, endurance towards suffering and hardship, tolerance, and great capacity to accommodate, all of which are qualities of Mother Earth (11).

These four elements are so intertwined within the body that their individual states cannot be identified if separated from one another. However, certain locations are considered the localization sites where a particular element is concentrated and dominates. For instance, the respiratory system is the place with the highest concentration of the element "suasana." The element of fire is most concentrated in the blood, the element of water is abundant in the lymphatic system, while the element of earth is represented predominantly in the muscles and tendons (12).

The presence of Tripurusa within the physical body as a material garment gives rise to reflections or mental images known as "angan-angan" (daydreams). These reflections are the intellectual faculties of humans and also have three aspects:

a) "Cipta" is the reflection of the Holy Spirit, representing thoughts or functions that form images of the mind.

b) "Nalar" or the thinker is an associative function that links various images or thoughts into a sequence. This ability is a result of the reflection of Suksma Sejati within the material garment.

c) "Pangerti" is the function of comprehending meanings, perceiving and seeing the whole, and delving into objects. This ability originates from the reflection of Suksma Kawekas.

These three aspects are localized within the central nervous system, with "cipta" and "nalar" situated in the brain and "pangerti" in a central cognitive center close to the heart. Additionally, all three aspects collectively exist within undifferentiated reflections of Tripurusa, specifically in the narrow sense of the mind, which also resides near the heart.

The entirety of the mind is sometimes depicted symbolically as a three-headed serpent (15). Each of the three heads represents a distinct differentiation of the mind, and all three reflections of Tripurusa possess supernatural energy.

The supernatural energy of "cipta" is called "Pangaribawa," from "nalar" it is known as "Prabawa," and "Kemayan" is the result of "pangerti." Particularly, "Kemayan" possesses magical power. These three aspects of the mind never act independently but always simultaneously (together at the same time). The physical body as a whole relates to the external world through the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and speech (language).

The term "perasa" refers to the subtle feelings of a person, a sort of invisible organ of touch, with which one can sense and understand the feelings and thoughts of others at a profound level, and through which one can accept or reject something. It is said that this "perasa" is located in the heart.

Speech serves as a bridge between the external world and humans, facilitating interaction between individuals and their environment and is therefore considered one of the senses. Among these senses, both the coarse material and subtle material aspects are distinguished. The coarse material part is commonly used in our fully conscious life for external observation. The subtle material part, on the other hand, continues to function during sleep, dreams, or daydreaming.

The material body is also composed of coarse material and subtle material parts. In the coarse material body, also referred to as "bumi" (earth), regular physiological processes such as metabolism, respiration, muscular movement, and others are carried out. In the subtle material body, also referred to as "langit" (heaven), psychological mechanisms are at work, necessary for shaping humans as spiritual beings.


The two physical bodies, coarse and subtle, are closely intertwined. It can be compared to the relationship between water and its vapor above. The influence comes from and is received by both parties.

The coarse material body (bumi) and the subtle material body (langit) are each divided into seven layers, not situated next to each other, but one permeates and penetrates the other. These seven layers occur due to differences in material density, arranged in seven concentrations.

Man is also referred to as the small universe or microcosm because all material elements and Tripurusa are represented within him. The universe, the cosmos, living with its material garments, is called the large universe or macrocosm.

Thus, within the structure of Indonesian candrajiwa, various centers can be observed:
I yang imateriil : Tripurusa,terdiri atas:
                                    Suksma Kawekas
									Suksma Sejati
									Roh Suci
II yang materiil atau terikat oleh materi :
	1. Angan-Angan : a. Pangerti - Kemayan
					 b. Nalar	- Prabawa
					 c.Cipta	- Pangaribawa
	2. Nafsu-nafsu :a. Mutmainah
					b. Amarah 
					c. Sufiah
					d. Lauamah 
	3. Rasa Pangrasa
	
The third center of vital-bound material is the center of feeling or life-feeling.
The desires, mind, and life-feeling are like "three creatures" that are different from each other, each striving and working for itself, thus causing disharmony (23).

The nature of these centers of vitality, their interrelationships, and their integration will be explored in the following chapters.

## CHAPTER III: FUNCTIONAL ASPECT


During the process of human bodily development, we observe various differentiated centers of vitality, each with its own distinct working area.

TRIPURUSA is the genuine immaterial center, which according to the Indonesian concept of candrajiwa, infuses Life into humans and makes them aware of their existence.

Next is the mind (angan-angan), which occurs as a reflection of TRIPURUSA within the physical body. The mind forms the self (AKU) of humans and potentially governs desires (rasa-pangrasa) and desires (nafsu-nafsu). (1)

The main characteristic of the mind is sovereignty (although limited), and it is always associated with desires. The mind realizes certain potentials due to its connection with desires and bodily executive tools. The mind supports and holds personal consciousness. Because of the close bond between the mind, desires, and impulses, this personal consciousness contains feelings of satisfaction (lust).

Therefore, personal consciousness conceals the consciousness of TRIPURUSA and causes this consciousness of TRIPURUSA to become hidden or latent. Because Suksma Kawekas is the original form of all Life, the consciousness present in TRIPURUSA is something collective, namely collective consciousness.

Life is everywhere, both in the microcosm and the macrocosm. There is unity and wholeness, unitas and totalitas. However, due to the limitations imposed by its own individuality, the human self (AKU) does not experience this totality. The sovereignty of the self distances and separates itself from that higher unity and wholeness. Embracing unity and wholeness as a higher sovereignty means placing one's own sovereignty beneath it. As a result of its individuality, separation arises, and thus, humans seem to be estranged from the original form of Life. In this estrangement, the self (AKU) functions as the central authority over desires, impulses, and executive tools. The mind (angan-angan) drives the activities of desires and can direct these activities through specific channels.

The outward self (AKU) represents the entire body and is also responsible for the activities of desires and impulses. However, according to the structure of the soul, the outward self (AKU) is merely formed by the mind (angan-angan). The outward self (AKU) encompasses desires and impulses as its envelope.

The components that form the mind (angan-angan): cipta (creation/imagination), nalar (reason/thought), and pangerti (understanding), along with the four powers of desire: lauwamah (selfish desire), sufiah (love and affection), amarah (anger), and mutmainah (contentment), are called the sibling powers of the self (AKU) (2). Thus, there are seven sibling powers. These powers merge to form an integrated force. This fusion is usually not complete, and as a result, each of the seven siblings still retains its individual freedom. If the fusion were total, the combined force is called Bayu Sejati (True Wind) (3), and with it, one can exhibit supernatural abilities such as seeing hidden things, predicting the future, healing, telepathy, and so on.

With Bayu Sejati, one can confidently find lost items, drive a car blindfolded in a busy street, perform a dance never seen before, use a foreign language never learned before, and more. Bayu Sejati can be activated by will. However, the integration of its powers is subject to certain conditions (see also the chapter: About the consciousness of the self). In the state of Bayu Sejati, consciousness remains completely intact.

There is a binding that integrates TRIPURUSA, the mind (angan-angan), desires (pangrasa), and the impulses (nafsu). Considering that all four can be seen as centers of the human, the question becomes where one places the focus of their life, on TRIPURUSA, the mind, desires, or impulses. Essentially, there are only two possibilities. First, the focus lies in the immaterial center, namely TRIPURUSA. And second, within the physical body. Within the physical body, the focus can be on the mind (intellectual faculties), the desires (qualities of emotions), or the impulses (forces of desires and will). 


How is the cooperation between the mind, feelings, and desires achieved?

Desires (nafsu), as unconscious impulses, act as the driving force or the motor that propels the mind (angan-angan) and feelings (pangrasa). The mind and feelings are tools situated within the realm of consciousness.

Desires, specifically lauwamah and mutmainah, are polar opposites (4). Lauwamah is an egocentric desire, whereas mutmainah is egocentricity. Sufiah and amarah can be considered auxiliary desires.

Initially, lauwamah releases an egocentric desire. Sufiah responds by releasing the desire to be united with the first desire. This desire activates amarah, which then supports the desire by generating the power of will or the tenacity to strive for that desire. The combination of lauwamah, sufiah, and amarah is passed on to the mind (angan-angan). The mind (cipta) then forms a mental image of what is desired. Nalar associates this mental image with other available mental images and/or with observations made at that moment. Thus, pangerti gains a comprehensive understanding of what is desired. With the understanding achieved by pangerti, the mental image of the desire becomes clearer. The mind (angan-angan) stimulates the senses to be more alert, further intensifies the desire, and mobilizes the tools of execution. Consequently, the desired outcome is achieved (6).

Desires can encompass not only material possessions but also abstract concepts, such as status, education level, progress, a certain state of mind, and so on.

Mutmainah cannot develop without sufiah. The combination of mutmainah with sufiah stimulates the desire for generosity, kindness, nobility of character, and love for fellow humans, leading to social and suprasocial tendencies (7). Subsequently, the same process occurs as with the mind (angan-angan), the senses, and the tools of execution. If the social and suprasocial aspects of mutmainah dominate, lauwamah no longer acts as a decision-maker or ruler but rather becomes an obedient servant. The egocentric qualities of lauwamah transform into physical strength, resilience against hardships, and tolerance (8). Therefore, there is a possibility of conversion in lauwamah, unlike mutmainah, which lacks this potential. The mind (angan-angan), which accumulates knowledge from the external world through the senses, is obligated to regulate desires in a way that maintains a positive relationship with and a good attitude towards the external world. Humans must adapt to the external world, which requires channeling their desires through specific avenues.


When desires are fulfilled, the physical body experiences positive feelings. On the other hand, if what is desired is lost, dies, is damaged, or remains unfulfilled, those feelings turn negative. In such cases, the unfulfilled desires along with their associated images are stored in the mind (angan-angan) in the narrow sense (10). The crowded mind (angan-angan) in the narrow sense leads to a state of illness (neuroses, psychoses, psychosomatic diseases) or causes the mind (angan-angan) to unload its contents through speech, hand gestures while talking, and dreams. A crowded mind (angan-angan) can be unloaded without harmful consequences through an attitude of acceptance and surrender (tawakkal) (11).

In the Indonesian candrajiwa (inner world), dreams are seen as an overflow of a crowded mind (angan-angan). Only a very small portion of dreams contains symbols of what the dreamer will experience in the near future (12). Dreams of this nature are referred to as "prophetic" in Dutch, while Jung uses the term "precognitive" (13). The meaning of such dreams, potentially, is known only to the dreamer because they hold personal symbols. Only a wise person (ahli budi) can interpret their meaning (14).

As mentioned before, the original activity of the true self (autochtoon) conceals the state of Tripurusa, making it latent. The true self feels it controls the physical body and considers itself as the ruler. If desire acts as a strong driving force while the mind (angan-angan) is weak in leading, then the mind (angan-angan) will conform to desires. In such a case, the combination of lauwamah and sufiah dominates the mind (angan-angan) (15), indicating that egocentric desires and wishes prevail within the individual.

When a person's reactions to the outside world are influenced by the dominance of desire (nafsu), it may appear as if the individual reacts with their animalistic instincts. If the mind (angan-angan) is dominant, the person will respond with their intellectual faculties. If the feelings (pangrasa) are dominant, then the person is characterized as emotional.

If mutmainah (contentment) is stronger than lauwamah (selfish desire), then the true self (sang AKU) exhibits a social-suprasocial attitude (16). In this state of mind, the true self acts in accordance with its conscience, which is considered in the Indonesian candrajiwa to consist of all human phylogenetic and ontogenetic experiences (17), in which mutmainah plays a significant role. Due to its social and suprasocial nature, the true self can easily direct itself towards Tripurusa, its immaterial center. If the mind (angan-angan) is directed towards Tripurusa, then the selection of thoughts, associations, and understanding aligns with Tripurusa. Thus, a more "noble" mind (cipta), a more "noble" reason (nalar), and a more "noble" comprehension (pangerti) emerge (18). Through this process, the center of human life shifts towards Rahsa Jati (the true consciousness of Tripurusa).

where Rahsa Jati is located ? If one is deeply attentive with the sense that Life, which exists within every living being, manifests within them, then they will be able to indicate where Rahsa Jati is located (19).

## CHAPTER IV: HUMANS IN GENERAL

As we have seen in the chapters "Structural Aspects" and "Functional Aspects," humans as a whole consist of three different forms of existence that are closely interconnected. From the external perspective, we have the form of existence that is gross material, fine material, and immaterial. The gross material form of existence is the world of objects that can be observed by the senses, where natural and chemical processes take place. This world corresponds to Karl Jaspers' "Sinnlichraumliche Welt" or sensory-spatial world.

This world of existence can be equated with the biological world. The connection with the external world occurs through the senses and vital functions such as eating, drinking, excretion, respiration, and temperature regulation. The life force in these gross material forms of existence is shaped by the desires of lauwamah, sufiah, amarah, and mutmainah. Here, lauwamah represents the desire for self-preservation, while mutmainah represents the desire for the preservation of communal life, in which the individual is situated. Sufiah is the source of desires and aspirations. The interplay of these desires takes place in the subconscious state of being. The existence of this gross material body is bound by space and time and lasts from conception to death.

The fine material form of existence is the world of the soul, the psychic world. In this world of the soul, dominated by angan-angan, it can be called the world of mind or the world of the self (AKU), as the self occupies a central place in angan-angan. This world corresponds to Karl Jaspers' "die seelisch-kulturelle Welt" or the psychocultural world. This world of the self is conscious, and because consciousness is limited, individuality exists, making it a limited consciousness, known as individual or personal consciousness. The existence of this fine material form is bound by space and time, but its existence is not bound by the gross material form of existence. The possibility of the existence of the world of the self after the death of the gross material body is accepted in the Indonesian human psyche

This world of the self (AKU) is connected to the external world through the senses. The existence of this world of the self is not always dependent on the vital functions of the gross material body, such as eating, drinking, defecation, respiration, and temperature regulation. The bridge between the gross material and fine material forms of existence is formed by feelings, emotions, or the life of sensations. The conscious desires have a connection with angan-angan (mind), allowing the activities of desires to enter the realm of personal consciousness. Thus, within the fine material form of existence, there are three complexes or centers of life, each operating independently and having specific connections with the other centers. These three complexes are responsible for the vitality of the fine material form of existence and are therefore called the centers of vitality. They are angan-angan, or intellectual powers, with the self (AKU) as its center; pancaindra, or the life of sensations; and nafsu-nafsu, or the life of will and desires.

The world of the self (AKU) therefore has needs determined by the requirements of these centers. These needs are classified by K. Jaspers as part of human cultural life. There is a psychic interaction between the world of the self and the external world, and through the influencing impact of contacts and encounters, angan-angan (mind), feelings, and desires develop. People accumulate a multitude of experiences, joys, and sorrows, gathering material to form a conception and a picture of how they should live and perceive the world around them. They construct a "candramanusia" (human worldview) and a "candradunia" (worldview of the external world). These "candramanusia" and "candradunia" become their guides, patterns, indicating how they should best help themselves, what they should do and should not do to preserve their existence and balance. This "candramanusia" and "candradunia" are their conscience. Thus, conscience arises from the interaction between the external world and humans, combining conscious desires, aware mind (angan-angan), and senses (pancaindra). Conscience is stored in the subconscious mind in its narrow sense but has a different structure than the conscious desires, so they are distinct. Certain aspects of conscience can be brought into consciousness as needed. The awakened aspects of conscience emerge as thought responses within the mind and then influence the life of sensations, desires, and the organs of action. Thus, conscience uses the available channels to exert its influence.

The third form of existence is the immaterial world of Life, Tripurusa, whose point of contact lies within Rahsa Jati. Rahsa Jati is not an organ, but rather a specific state of the soul's life, also known as the essence of the life of sensations. It serves as the gateway or threshold for the potential immaterial existence. This world can be equated with the "metaphysical world" of K. Jaspers. To be able to transition from the psychic form of existence (the world of self) to the potential immaterial form (the realm of Tripurusa), there must be continuity. This continuity exists in the form of consciousness or the state of being conscious.

The potential immaterial existence is not bound by matter, and therefore not bound by space and time. When consciousness is present in the potential immaterial realm, it is no longer bound by anything and thus not limited by individuality. In such a state, consciousness becomes universal and collective. This is the world of collective consciousness. This world exists within and outside of humans. There is no longer a need for communication between the external world and the inner world. The senses, limited by their nature, are no longer required. Collective consciousness is a totality. As such, there is no longer a need, and therefore no possibility for growth. All the limitations of psychic life disappear. The personal restrictions of angan-angan (mind), pangrasa (feelings), and nafsu-nafsu (desires) vanish. There is no longer any personal psychic life; the immaterial center uses the foundation of consciousness directly. There is no more psychic interaction with the external world, and the senses are only used in their motor functions. Thus, within humans, there exist three worlds simultaneously, intermingling and coexisting.

From an "external" to "internal" perspective, it can be said that the worlds of gross material, subtle material, and immaterial have existence or existence.

It can also be said that there are forms of biological, psychic, and spiritual existence. These sequences can also be explained based on another aspect, namely from collective subconscious, through personal consciousness, and personal consciousness to collective subconscious, or it can also be described from the fulfillment of unlimited desires, through the fulfillment of limited desires, to reach empty contentment (as there are no desires left).

Each individual places the center of gravity of their life in a unique way, different from others. Each possibility of existence has its own unique form, guidance, style, and existence. If the center of gravity lies in the realm of gross material possibilities, then the functions of desires or biology dominate. If the center of gravity lies in the psychic realm, then imagination and/or feelings dominate. In the realm of immaterial possibilities, individual life ceases to exist.

Jung would call the various forms of self-expression in such a manner as personal or archetypal. There is a possibility of shifting the center of gravity from the realm of gross material to the immaterial realm, the metaphysical form of existence. With this shift, changes occur in needs, perspectives, attitudes, and lifestyles.

By living in a certain way, we can shift the center of gravity. Each shift is only possible by accepting the new lifestyle and discarding the old. Hence, it can be said that there is a path from the realm of gross material possibilities to the immaterial realm. This path is marked by changes in activities and reactions of the existing centers, as well as the hindrances from those centers themselves, based on the law of inertia. The immaterial possibilities can be considered as the ultimate and goal of this path, thus being the ideal state of human beings. In the candrajiwa of the Indonesian people, this ideal state is potentially achievable by every individual.

The mind arises from the reflection of Tripurusa within the physical body, just like the moonlight is a reflection of sunlight. As Tripurusa consists of three interconnected aspects in a certain hierarchy, the same is reflected in the mind with three interconnected aspects within the same hierarchy.

The absolute sovereignty of Tripurusa is reflected in the individual sovereignty of the mind. The "I" (Aku) within the mind causes humans to feel that they are alive. This feeling of life is accompanied by a sense of satisfaction that covers the empty consciousness of Tripurusa from the fulfillment of desires, causing Tripurusa's consciousness to become latent. In the journey from the coarse material form to the immaterial form, the main issue is how to reawaken the collective consciousness of Tripurusa. The power to leave behind the fulfillment of desires originates from desire (mutmainah) in collaboration with feeling (sufiah). This combination is the power to pursue higher aspirations and is known as "asmara sufi," the desire for social and suprasocial matters.

In society, there are types of individuals who place their emphasis on the coarse material possibilities, as well as types who place it on the fine material possibilities. At the current level of human development, individuals who prioritize the immaterial possibilities are very rare.

In the prototype of individuals who prioritize the mind (angan-angan), their sovereignty is highly pronounced. They tend to be very individualistic. Alongside this individualism, their sovereignty also leads to characteristics such as a love for independent thinking and, simultaneously, a dislike for coercion, restrictions, authority of others, and traditions.

Another function of the mind is to act as a tool for perceiving the external world. Thus, humans can interact with the material world. The mind is dynamic and knows no rest. Stopping means death for the mind. The mind deals with the external world, schematizing and categorizing it into smaller parts.

Sovereignty does not like to be accompanied by other sovereignties. Because of its aversion to other sovereignties, it removes everything that it handles from its own self. The surrounding world is viewed merely as an object, devoid of any subjectivity. The absolute subject, Tripurusa, is considered non-existent. The "I" of the mind (angan-angan) is preserved as the subject. This can be understood, although not consistently, and therefore, it must consider its own subjectivity as non-existent.

To undermine the sovereignty of others from their thrones, this type of mind views others by objectifying them, reducing them to mere objects. For the mind, there is either existence or non-existence; there is no middle ground. Consequently, this prototype cannot put itself in the shoes of others. There is no generosity towards others. Others are only accepted as long as they benefit its own sovereignty. It does not acknowledge the territorial boundaries of others as valid for itself. Nothing is sacred and deserving of respect in its eyes. There is no tolerance. Fear is foreign to this type; it bravely faces everything. Nothing can restrain it. The mind exudes an air of power, authority, and responsibility. This type of mind does not actually recognize an ultimate goal; it is always on duty and focused on achievements.

The strongest evidence that the external world is not sovereign for the mind (angan-angan) lies in the fact that everything it works on is dissected and analyzed. Scientific knowledge is the result of the mind's boundless and incessant activity until it reaches a point of perfect subjectivity. At that point, the mind can no longer capture and break things apart. It reaches a point where it recognizes its limitations and is forced to surrender.

In this prototype, feelings (pangrasa) and desires (nafsu) are used to support sovereignty. Feelings are reduced to indicators of things directly relevant to the physical body alone, limited to positive and negative emotions. Desires become the driving force and tools available to this prototype.

Feelings are the center that creates the psychic climate, the soul's atmosphere that is held and preserved. It encompasses, contains, and nurtures everything within it. All that fills the soul's atmosphere is either embraced or avoided, solely for the sake of maintaining that atmosphere. Sovereignty is summarized differently, fully respected. The subject is valued above all else, even things (objects) are objectified. There is no subjectivity or objectivity; everything is done for the preservation of the atmosphere. This atmosphere must not be disturbed, even if its maintenance might cause harm in the psychic, material, or physical realm. There is complete tolerance that governs other considerations.

Besides the nature of creating and nurturing the soul's climate, the binding function is the main characteristic of "pangrasa" (feeling). Therefore, the relationships and connections among subjects are emphasized. In contrast to "angan-angan" (mind) that highlights the individual itself (exist or not exist), "pangrasa" (feeling) perceives its connection (close or distant) with others. Individuals are considered equal in the view of "pangrasa" (feeling). It has the ability to form synthesis and strives to encompass its climate as much as possible. In this world, there are various aspects with opposite polarities, so "pangrasa" (feeling) always seeks the greatest common divisor and the smallest common multiple, until it reaches the point where it must encompass the entire world and its contents. The function of "pangrasa" (feeling) ends when the greatest common divisor is also the smallest common multiple.

In this prototype, the mind (angan-angan) does not develop. This tool is not used and limits itself to observing and contemplating things directly seen. It enjoys pondering. Its nature is static, conservative, and fond of tradition. Even here, its motivation and source lie in desire (nafsu).

Desire (nafsu) is the center of wants, desires, and physical energy. Its instruments will move if the outcome is clear and will provide a positive feeling. In this prototype, whether it's the Sufi love or a combination of lauwamah and sufiah, they will only act if there is an immediate reward. The mind (angan-angan) and feelings (pangrasa) in this type are used successively to ensure a prosperous life and as indicators of security and well-being throughout life.

Tripurusa is the fourth center and is not bound by the material. The Holy Spirit (Roh Suci), as the true soul of humans, utilizes the mind (angan-angan) to subdue desire (nafsu). This subjugation aims to enable the Holy Spirit to fulfill its duty of directing itself towards Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati.

Regarding desire (nafsu), the Holy Spirit is the ruler; concerning Suksma Sejati, it is a servant. By fulfilling these two duties, the Ani prototype successfully instructs the mind (angan-angan) and feelings (pangrasa) to carry out their vital tasks for the physical body and to control them further. There are self-restraints and voluntary asceticism, along with the complete ability to fully use the mind (angan-angan), feelings (pangrasa), and desire (nafsu) to handle the external world.

For the purpose of devotion to Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati, the cooperation of feelings (pangrasa) and the mind (angan-angan) is used to differentiate subject from object and prepare the climate for the meeting of Suksma Sejati with the Holy Spirit (Roh Suci). In this type, the other three centers of vital energy are not reduced in their functions. On the contrary, their three functions and the relationships among them are fully developed and used in the most efficient manner. In a humble and unconditional attitude, with no memory of individual limitations, the Holy Spirit (Roh Suci) is accepted into Suksma Sejati.

Because of continuously accumulating new experiences, both the individual's inner world (candramanusia) and the outer world (candradunia) undergo constant changes, resulting in a perpetual gap between one's actual state at a given moment and their perceived state in that very moment. This difference stimulates the individual to bridge the gap. Naturally, when this difference is not perceived as significant, the motivation to bridge it would not arise. This situation occurs when one is compelled to conform to an image that does not match their true state.

There are automatism mechanisms within humans, which occur due to the "illumination" of the mind (angan-angan) by the conscience (hati-nurani). These automatism mechanisms act like a mirror in front of our own thoughts, feelings, and desires, allowing us to see our shortcomings. This mirror is magical because the deficiencies observed are significant enough to prompt self-awareness and inspire action, yet not so overwhelming as to cause despair or trauma.

Being aware of the disparity between one's self-image at a particular moment and the conscience's perception gives rise to a sense of guilt that must be redeemed through one of the ways. Atonement means directing oneself, surrendering, and sacrificing oneself to their ideal candramanusia, which possesses a certain authority. This feeling of guilt is an expression of the responsibility emanating from the conscience.

Directing oneself towards the conscience also involves engaging in a dialogue with it. In the inner world of the Indonesian people (candrajiwa), the conscience represents Tripurusa for those who have permanently placed their focus within Tripurusa. The conscience operates in a conscious state, above emotions, shadows, and thoughts, above desires, passions, and the will's functions, and it carries certain attributes connected to humans and their environment. These attributes emerge as humans perceive Tripurusa from their limited human perspective and name it using words from their limited vocabulary.

When a person calls out to the conscience, it is as if they place their existence and environmental conditions against an unlimited and unnamed backdrop, which makes their relationship with this backdrop evident. Tripurusa is not merely an idealized conscience; it is a Living entity actively embracing, guiding, and assisting humans. The call of humans to Tripurusa will never be in vain.

Humans form mental images of the external world within their minds, treating these images as though they were the external world itself, preserving their connections as thoughts, opinions, decisions, and so on. Consequently, an alternative external world becomes directly available to humans, and they can use it as they wish. They can employ it for work, play, and connect it to their emotions. However, with this usage, a certain dependency on the content of their mind's images arises, meaning the preserved external world. It is as if thoughts, opinions, associations, decisions, and the like regain their dominion over them.

On one hand, individuals can strengthen their sovereignty over their thoughts, but on the other hand, thoughts can gain their own sovereignty over the individual. The contents of one's mind can activate desires and intentions, arising suddenly and stirring up emotions that lead to restlessness. Just as one approaches the external world with the sufi (laya) attitude, one must also approach the contents of their mind if they seek tranquility and balance.

Being aware of death can bring peace. It means directing oneself to a state of soul without desires, thoughts, and emotions. This attitude also evokes a desire to abandon the current way of life and embark on a new one, in accordance with the will of Life.

The desire to attain a state of soul where the "I" no longer exercises its sovereignty but willingly sacrifices it and merges into a monotonous (single-toned) relationship with the external world, without differences or pressures, is different from the desire to destroy the physical body, where the "I" still resides. The latter approach does not diminish the "I's" sovereignty.

By strengthening the sufi (laya) attitude, a sense of responsibility and awareness of greater obligations grow, which can be seen as symptoms of one's realization of the Supreme Oneness, the ultimate source of all life's unity.

Lowering the content of one's own thoughts from its throne means that humans detach themselves from their own thoughts, to the extent that those thoughts can no longer influence them. It also means that humans withdraw from their own mind and reach a position where they no longer use their intellect and reasoning. The intellect and reasoning, located in the brain, perceive the perceptions that come to humans via the senses. The intellect is what makes contact with desires, leading various desires to be realized, and also with feelings, so emotions participate in the realization of those desires. Reasoning associates images into endless fantasies. Without the intellect and reasoning, without contact with the brain, humans arrive at a position without imaginary fantasies. In such a state, tranquility and peace arise. Understanding still exists, but it is not located in the brain and is no longer disturbed by various imaginations. What arises is an empty and shadowless understanding. In this position, humans cannot be influenced by the external world. Humans orient themselves to the inner world. They are in perfect balance, which is the midpoint of all polar resistances in their lives.

Such conscious state is characterized by complete and unconditional surrender to the immaterial Life. Whatever comes is accepted wholeheartedly. The sovereignty of the "I" of thoughts is reduced to zero. Humans no longer use their power to control and lead desires. In this state, the forces of desires cease to function. Here lies the ultimate capacity and humanity of humans. In the candrajiwa of Indonesian humans, those who reach this state achieve the position of their True Soul: the Holy Spirit.(11)


We see three processes to achieve the position of the Holy Spirit, all of which must be carried out in harmony with each other to maintain personal balance. These processes are:

1. Letting go of attachment to all things that are subject to change.
2. Adopting a positive attitude, an attitude of universal love and impersonal responsibility.
3. Directing oneself towards the Transcendent within, without resorting to personal illusions, hopes, and desires.

It takes great courage to carry out the above. The familiar, which has bound the heart, must be abandoned to enter into a state of being that is often incomprehensible to one's environment.

Reaching the level of the Holy Spirit is a potential ability inherent within every individual.

The connection with the Unbounded and Unnameable leads the three vital centers to a single point beyond the self. This connection manifests itself as a quality that encompasses the entire personality as a totality and holds that personality within it. This quality can be differentiated into awareness, trust, and obedience. Awareness is the quality of constantly awakening the conscience within oneself. Trust is the loyalty to the conscience in all circumstances, and obedience is the precise fulfillment of that conscience.

Harmony contains integration within itself. Integration is formed by the level of control the self has over desire and feeling, and the willingness of desire and feeling to obey the self. If the mind is used to control and lead desire in accordance with the will of the Inner Self, then gradually, the divine love will dominate. This divine love aligns itself with the qualities of the Inner Self, so that eventually, the mind is no longer needed to govern desire, or in other words, the sovereignty of the self is no longer required. Feeling is now directed towards the Inner Self. At this level, the self can purely direct itself towards the Inner Self, without fear of the intellect being disturbed by desire and feeling. With the growth of harmony within the human soul, integration also grows, until harmony and integration become one in the level of the Holy Spirit.

In daily life, humans feel placed between the vast world and the immaterial life. On one hand, they know little about the immaterial Life, and on the other hand, they also have a perception of the surrounding external world. They are bound to both. If we refer to the spiritual structure of human beings in the Indonesian psyche, this connection can be expressed in three aspects.

First, this attachment can be at the level of the mind (angan-angan). This means that people always want to exercise their sovereignty in their interactions with the external world. They organize their lives in such a way that they can always assert their sovereignty in any form, and, conversely, their lives are dominated by a perspective that only sees power relations within society.

If this attachment lies in desires (nafsu), then it is lauwamah that acts as the binder. Lauwamah is the selfish desire, greed, and sensual desires. The attachment manifests in insatiable desires to acquire and possess the external world and/or to satisfy sensual desires. There is an unquenchable thirst to obtain material wealth and/or to gratify unbridled passions. This pursuit does not necessarily involve considerations of sovereignty or reasons at the level of feelings (pangrasa) but is solely the pursuit of gratification and the desire to possess someone of the opposite sex without attaching oneself to anyone.

Feelings (pangrasa) are the center that creates the psychic climate within a human being and radiates outward. Attachment to the ever-changing world via feelings means holding onto and being closely attached to a particular psychic climate or pattern. For various reasons, people may be unwilling to let go of this climate, perhaps because a certain climate they have experienced provided a sense of safety, security, freedom from responsibility, and the ability to be passive and live in a sort of worldly paradise.

With spiritual growth, individuals reach a stage where they must develop responsibilities, be aware of dangers, and work. The situation that creates a sense of safe and peaceful climate is in the past, and they rely on memories to hold onto that climate. Such people are somewhat conservative, lagging behind their time, and view current events with a particular perspective. They avoid adventures that offer various possibilities for different emotions. Because those emotions will inevitably lead them to different climates. The climate they want to hold onto tightly, no matter what the situation, can trigger memories of when they were in the embrace of their spiritual mother. However, this climate doesn't always have to be related to a mother's bond or a father's bond. Every situation a person finds themselves in can become a climate that makes them always want to return to it and mobilize their mind, desires, and instruments of action to fulfill their wishes.

Harmony (alignment) can only begin to emerge if a person consciously strives to detach themselves, increasingly so, from the influences of their external environment and dedicate their efforts to a single goal with the Life within themselves and within every living being, through their deepest consciousness, namely Rahsa Jati.

Even though humans are a part of the macrocosm and exist within it, and the immaterial Life envelops and permeates the macrocosm, the gateway for humans to access Life lies deep within themselves (13). The fact that humans can enter the immaterial Life and unite and merge themselves into it means that within humans, there is also something that is the same as Life. This something is the Holy Spirit (Roh Suci). If a person is to be united with the immaterial Life outside themselves, it means that their consciousness must go out of themselves through their senses. The senses are material tools, hence limited. Therefore, it can be concluded that the union of humans with Life cannot be achieved through an outward path, but rather humans must first strive for complete liberation from their own intrapsychic relationships within their lives.

The gateway to Life, whether it exists within or outside of human beings, lies within the deepest essence of humans (14). If a person only orients themselves towards the external world and knows nothing about the Immaterial Life, then the macrocosm indeed appears boundless compared to themselves. Thus, the human mind (candramanusia) consists only of experiential materials gathered from encounters with the external world. It cannot transcend those experiences with the external world. Conversely, when the Holy Spirit willingly surrenders itself entirely to Suksma Sejati, a state arises where the Holy Spirit receives inspiration or revelation from Suksma Sejati. This intuition (inspiration) or revelation is unconditional, meaning it cannot be intentionally induced in any way. To me, there is no essential difference between inspiration and revelation. The inspiration or revelation itself cannot be depicted. One can only depict the accompanying phenomena, which are representations of the human state in which the inspiration or revelation manifests. However, since every person can receive inspiration or revelation, these accompanying phenomena may differ significantly, depending on the individual's inner state.

When someone receives inspiration or revelation, they are at that moment very "close" to Suksma Sejati, like how a piameter is closely attached to the brain. Once the inspiration or revelation is complete, the person returns to their daily conscious state, and they only experience echoes of the atmosphere they momentarily entered. How they experience the atmosphere of inspiration or revelation depends on the extent of the difference between their daily inner climate and the state of being "close" to Suksma Sejati. If the difference is significant, the inspiration or revelation will undoubtedly cause intense turmoil in their thoughts and emotions. If the difference is not significant, the accompanying phenomena will be much calmer. Intuition or revelation is the encounter of individuals with Suksma Sejati, the encounter of individual consciousness with collective consciousness.

As inspiration or revelation comes in a state of silence within the mind, desire, and feelings, humans experience it in their deepest selves. Sometimes, inspiration or revelation comes during sleep, as if Life chooses a favorable moment for the person in question. If one desires or hopes for it, the revelation will not come at all, as both desire and hope are influenced by the mind.

Inspiration or revelation may manifest as shadows, words, understanding of something, or enlightenment. However, these shadows are not perceived by the senses, but rather experienced deeply within oneself. It is as if the person translates their encounter into shadows, words, or understanding of something.

In summarizing the inspiration (intuition or revelation), it can be recognized by the following characteristics:

1. It arises as something original (autochthonous) from our deepest essence.
2. It is not dependent on time and place.
3. It cannot be deliberately induced.
4. It emerges as a shadow, utterance, or understanding of something.
5. It is not a sensory experience.
6. The person receiving it experiences a great sense of peace and temporary happiness.
7. There is a feeling of certainty and truth.
8. There are no bodily sensations of power or anything other than what is mentioned in 6 and 7.
9. No external forces are involved.
10. At the moment of revelation or inspiration, thoughts, emotions, and desires cease.

What we commonly refer to as inspiration (intuition) in everyday life, which often provides us with solutions in certain situations, is not the same as the inspiration (intuition) mentioned earlier. I believe that it is the result of our own inner powers at work, which, as mentioned before, possess mystical abilities but can also speak untruths if not used wisely.

The powers of the seven brothers can be combined by humans according to their will, meaning that we as humans have the ability to integrate the powers of the seven brothers into one fully integrated force. This ultimate force can be commanded to perform something according to our will, and it can also be stopped according to its own will.

It has been mentioned that the mystical powers of the mind are pangaribawa, prabawa, and kemayan, and that kemayan, in particular, possesses special strength. Bayu Sejati is the state of the soul that can use these powers without obstruction. Bayu Sejati is still material in nature and entirely bound, obliged to absolute obedience to the will of Tripurusa. In Bayu Sejati, the forces of desire remain completely dormant, and the mind frees itself from desires and feelings, allowing the development of its power undisturbed.

If a person intends to use Bayu Sejati, for example, to gain personal benefits or to show off, or for other egocentric reasons, Bayu Sejati will not act or do anything else that involves warning or educational purposes. It is our sibling, not a pack animal to be treated as one pleases. In the words of Bayu Sejati itself: "I am the force and the veil of the Holy Spirit" (16).

In the state of Bayu Sejati, the vital centers of a person no longer have autonomy over one another. There are no more disturbing thoughts, sudden desires, or whims to disrupt. In such a state, the power of the material elements of a human reaches its perfection. Every thought, emotion, desire, and will surrenders to its absolute authority. This state of the soul can be achieved by a person before the focal point of their consciousness shifts and settles in the consciousness of the Holy Spirit. For those who attain this state, their everyday self is Bayu Sejati and doesn't need to be awakened to be used. There is no more fear, doubt, hope, or stimulation of desires that can hinder their unconditional surrender to Tripurusa.

Every human being who constantly directs themselves towards Tripurusa adds one more factor to candramanusia, namely the factor of being guided by Suksma Sejati into intuition or revelation. This factor is not dependent on specific experiences and transcends all experiences. As this revelation is sometimes experienced as words or understanding of something, Suksma Sejati is also known as the Divine Word and Divine Guide.

Surrendering to Tripurusa means ending the life of the ego. Only when the ego-mind dies, a higher and more sovereign self, the AKU-Roh Suci, is born.

By letting go of the mind's desires (AKU-angan-angan), the unchallengeable sovereignty emerges. The limited sovereignty of the mind's desires, which is influenced by the external world, is now replaced with an unchallengeable power, the Almighty. The influence of material elements on the Holy Spirit has been eliminated, but the consciousness of the Holy Spirit can govern matter. There is no longer mutual influence between the two as when the mind's desires were in power. The consciousness of the Holy Spirit is the consciousness of the light of the Divine Warrior, although still limited within the physical body, even though it is already personal. It is also the state of conscious-being-Life, contained in Suksma Sejati as the True Guide and Suksma Kawekas as the Source of all Life. (18)

The consciousness of the Holy Spirit in this Tripurusa contains a promise to only direct oneself towards Suksma Sejati and Suksma Kawekas. This promise can be formulated with the following words:

> Suksma Kawekas ialah sembahan hamba yang sejati dan Suksma Sejati adalah Utusan Suksma Kawekas yang Sejati, adalah Pemimpin dan Guru hamba yang Sejati. Hanya Suksma Kawekas menguasai semua alam dan seisinya, hanya Suksma Sejati yang menuntun para hamba semua. Semua kekuasaan, ialah kekuasaan Suksma Kawekas, ada di tangan Suksma Sejati dan hamba semua ada dalam kekuasaan Suksma Sejati (19).


> Suksma Kawekas is the true worship of servants, and Suksma Sejati is the True Messenger of Suksma Kawekas, the Leader and Teacher of true servants. Only Suksma Kawekas rules over all realms and their contents, only Suksma Sejati guides all servants. All power, the power of Suksma Kawekas, is in the hands of Suksma Sejati, and all servants are within the power of Suksma Sejati. (19)

This is the life pledge of the Holy Spirit, which is its declaration of faith.

The next stage is the merging of the Holy Spirit into Suksma Sejati. The light is called back by the Owner through Him who holds it (20). The Holy Spirit has merged into Suksma Sejati (21). Its consciousness is no longer limited to itself. That consciousness encompasses itself and everything else, all and together. And it turns out that its sovereignty is not even lost. The limitations of sovereignty within its body have been eliminated. Now arises an unlimited sovereignty. This boundless consciousness, which has absolute sovereignty, is within everything, encompasses everything, the entire world, the entire universe.

## BAB V : CANDRA IDEAL

The ideal Candra is a certain state of consciousness in which all personal consciousness with all its psychic activities shift and unite in collective consciousness. If we imagine in general terms, there are three levels of consciousness in humans: the level of gross physical (collective consciousness), the level of subtle physical or psychic activities (personal consciousness), and the metaphysical level (collective consciousness). One level of consciousness can shift to another level, but this ideal Candra is a permanent manifestation of collective consciousness, with no possibility of descending back to personal consciousness and collective consciousness.

In humans in general, the center of gravity of consciousness lies in personal consciousness with all its psychic activities. Collective unconsciousness or collective consciousness is indeed always related to sending messages to personal consciousness, but the emphasis of life is not placed on it. The Self is the complex of the organizing-intelligent, the whole self. In humans, there is indeed a totality, not just an individual, but the collective unconscious and collective consciousness still have autonomy from that totality. Both have a unity relationship with personal consciousness but also have freedom of movement towards it. In the degree of collective consciousness, as the ultimate goal achieved by humans, personal consciousness and collective unconsciousness no longer exist. Collective consciousness is an absolute totality that is transcendent. Individual psychic life no longer exists. Desires are limited to vital functions such as hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and so on, which are limited to bodily needs without any influence on spiritual life. In the degree of ideal Candra, the functions of will, emotional life, and imagination have developed and ultimately converge within collective consciousness. There is no differentiation in will, feeling, and logos. Terms such as high, noble, all-knowing, all-powerful occur because of comparison with the limited within personal consciousness.

The governing principle in humans who reach this level is complex, such as the self-consciousness within personal consciousness, and collective consciousness has its own complexity. There is no identical complex in humans. Therefore, there is no longer an inner world and an outer world, no more polarity or opposition between poles. Humans have a consciousness that becomes the divisor and multiplier of the largest and smallest communion of all consciousness. In the terminology of Indonesian human candrajiwa, it means that humans have reached the level of Suksma Sejati. The level of the Holy Spirit has elevated to the Degree of Suksma Sejati.

The Degree of the Holy Spirit is essentially immaterial, but it still has individuality within it. To elevate to the level of Suksma Sejati, humans must release all their individuality. Since collective consciousness is beyond the control of personal consciousness, the only way for personal consciousness to ascend into collective consciousness is through total merging of oneself. However, this total merging must not involve any action, as actions contain the potential for individuality. Total merging can only be achieved through complete surrender, in perfect silence, without any remembrance of the individual. In the absolute silence of the individual, the merging comes from the side of collective consciousness, just as the separation of the Holy Spirit from collective consciousness also comes from Suksma Sejati as the executor of Suksma Kawekas. The content of the silence of personal consciousness becomes the declaration of faith.

The five senses, which in previous personal conscious life served as gateways for impressions from the external world and as tools to express inner thoughts, have a different meaning in the level of Suksma Sejati. Firstly, impressions from the external world are no longer necessary, and secondly, there are no longer inner aspects. There are no more experiences. This degree is the result of experiences on one hand, and on the other hand, it is above all experiences.

The five senses only function as motor tools, while their function as receivers of psychic reception has been eliminated. This means that what is spoken and shown by the five senses and the executing tools are certain qualities and aspects of Suksma Sejati, collective consciousness. These qualities are expressed in Indonesian human candrajiwa as follows:
"Benih (Roh Suci) terlahir dari kekuasaan-Ku,
Yang terlihat adalah kebi jaksanaan-ku,
Yang diucapkan adalah penerangan-Ku,
Yang terdengar adalah kekuasaan-Ku,
Yang terasa adalah keadilan-ku,
Yang tercium adalah kehadiran-Ku,
Cipta adalah tangan-Ku,
Nafas adalah kekuatan-Ku dan singgasana-Ku,
Badan adalah busana-Ku dan kendaraan-Ku," (2)."Benih (Roh Suci) terlahir dari kekuasaan-Ku,
Yang terlihat adalah kebi jaksanaan-ku,
Yang diucapkan adalah penerangan-Ku,
Yang terdengar adalah kekuasaan-Ku,
Yang terasa adalah keadilan-ku,
Yang tercium adalah kehadiran-Ku,
Cipta adalah tangan-Ku,
Nafas adalah kekuatan-Ku dan singgasana-Ku,
Badan adalah busana-Ku dan kendaraan-Ku," (2).
In Indonesian human candrajiwa, someone who has reached this level of spiritual attainment is said to have completed their greatest liberation.

Since there is no longer any psychic life, there are no more intra-psychic relationships. There is no longer a conscience, no longer conscious desires. There is no longer the self, caught between the conscience and conscious desires. There are no more autonomous complexes.

The words and outpourings of such a person can actually be experienced as intuition by everyone in their deepest selves. However, not everyone can create the climate for intuition to arise, so the presence of a liberated individual provides a special opportunity for their contemporaries. They can perceive through their senses the words and other manifestations of someone who has attained a collective consciousness. And this is much easier than creating the climate for inspiration.

If what can be perceived through the senses is symbolized as the earth, and the metaphysical as the sky, then Suksma Sejati descends to the earth within a liberated individual. Thus, the presence of a liberated individual facilitates the path to liberation for their contemporaries. Because of their presence, it is as if there is a dispensation. Things happen that would not normally occur. Progress in the formation of personality occurs rapidly, unlike usual. It is like a person collecting water during the rainy season.

In this liberated state, Suksma Sejati directs itself towards Suksma Kawekas. The Dynamic and the Moving seek and direct themselves towards the Still. The comparative relationship between Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati can be most accurately formulated with symbols such as the sun with its heat, the moon with its light, water with its spring, flowers with their fragrance, musical instruments with their melodies.

The relationship between Suksma Sejati and humans is best illustrated through symbols. Suksma Sejati is the True Guru, the True Guide, the Way Shower, the Leader, the Word, the Path, the Torch, the Liberator, and so on.

We must be able to distinguish its form, appearance, and physicality from its essence. Its physical body dies, dissolves, it is temporary and will always remain temporary. The point is for us to recognize again the eternal and true nature within ourselves and to recognize it again in every human being.

## CHAPTER VI: THE PATH

What we can call the path is a process of changes, experiences, levels, states of mind, states of consciousness, and so on, that are experienced by humans and transcended. All of these are aspects of their personality that shape and create a particular history, while the series of portraits from different states at specific moments represent the path. Karl Jaspers wrote in his book "Psychologie der Weltanschauungen" (Psychology of Worldviews), 1951, page 1101: "There is a way out of the state of consciousness in which we all live, out of this kind of subject-object division, in this phase of thinking, to higher states of consciousness, which are called recognition!" (2)

This path is highly personal. Others cannot follow the same path. If they are curious to go through it, they will impose their own personality. At most, people can use the same guidance that exists on someone else's path, or at most, the two paths can run parallel or intersect for a while, but placing one's own path directly onto someone else's path will result in attachment to tradition and prejudices, disregarding one's own spontaneity and originality, two distinctive characteristics of humanity. It is possible that one person on their life path can clearly grasp and understand the experiences of others, but both paths remain unique to each individual. Based on the fact that a path occurs through the convergence of the macrocosm and microcosm, where each microcosm has its own personal pattern, and where the macrocosm is different for each individual, it can be seen in an instant that there cannot be two identical life paths. Carp stated in his book "Problemen van het mens-zijn" (Problems of Human Existence) that "The universe is the glasses that humans use to see."

In this Indonesian candramanusia, as a guide on the path, values of susila (moral principles to be adhered to and internalized), prohibitions, and regulations for implementation are mentioned.

This path is actually a systematic series of steps and explanations of something that has been vaguely depicted for centuries in the eyes of the Javanese people. If someone understands the Indonesian candramanusia from Soenarto, they can rediscover the meaning of similarities in certain wayang stories, which originate from Javanese culture and are embedded in the epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. One example is the story of Dewa Ruci.

Furthermore, in the three comedic characters Semar, Gareng, and Petruk, who are inseparable from the main roles in each play, I see symbolic depictions of certain levels in achieving the ideal candramanusia.

In the Hastasila by Soenarto et al., we can read that the path begins when the Syahadat (Islamic declaration of faith) is forgotten and the Holy Spirit enters the physical body. A person loses their compass and must find it again. To rediscover this compass, they must obtain the cooperation of their seven sibling energies who were born together when the Holy Spirit, veiled in unseen elements, entered the womb of a woman through a man. Without recognizing their sibling energies and without their certain cooperation, one cannot find the way back to Tripurusa.

One must seek their assistance in order to not be disturbed in their devotion to Suksma Kawokas through Suksma Sejati. They must ask them to keep them away from temptations and dangers that come from the outside world, as these sibling energies are the entry points for temptations. If they isolate themselves from the outside world, one will not be able to fully experience the Syahadat.

Within the macrocosm, there are energies that can harm humans, in the sense that these energies can cause humans to live in a way that is not in harmony with the Will of Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati, the Eternal Messenger. These dangers can come from two sources. First, they come from materialistic attractions that are transient in nature. The second danger comes from the gods. These gods are beings of Suksma Kawekas. Their bodies consist only of the element of fire. They do not possess the Holy Spirit like humans do. They have a self-consciousness formed by certain potentials from Suksma Kawekas. These potentials are called Kemayan or Maya. In the structure of humans as spiritual beings, we also see the presence of Kemayan as a latent power of understanding, which is the ability to comprehend. Therefore, the gods have this ability to understand. However, they do not possess the other aspects of imagination. They do not have thought and reason, so they do not have the function of shaping thought images and associating them.

Humans, with Tripurusa as their essence, essentially have greater power than the gods because Suksma Sejati is the True Guide and Protector within humans. However, this power only manifests when someone is close to Suksma Sejati. If someone is not close to Suksma Sejati, they can be possessed by gods as a sign of the gods' victory. Attachment to the world hinders humans from shifting the center of their lives to the sacred Origin.

There are three values of susila that serve as teachers for devotion to Tripurusa, which must be practiced every day. These three values are:

1. Eling - awareness of
2. Pracaya - belief in
3. Mituhu - obedience to Tripurusa

These three values of susila, known as Trisila, contain the Syahadat that is proclaimed by the Holy Spirit before someone acquires a material physical body (Sila - values of susila, teachings of susila).

Ad.1

To always be aware, it is necessary to engage in devotion by surrendering our whole, humble, and purified heart.

There are three levels of devotion:
1. Devotion of the physical self to the Holy Spirit.
This devotion is the devotion of humans who are still "young" and "inexperienced" in their souls.
2. Devotion of the Holy Spirit to Suksma Sejati or the devotion of humans whose souls have matured.
3. Devotion of Suksma Sejati to Suksma Kawekas, which is the devotion of humans who have attained liberation and, therefore, have noble conduct.

The first and second levels can be achieved by anyone in their current lives, as long as they truly follow the guidance of Suksma Sejati.

Humans cannot reach Suksma Kawekas without the mediation of Suksma Sejati. Bats cannot fly in the daytime; their eyes are dazzled by the sunlight. Suksma Sejati is like the moon, reflecting the sunlight in a way that does not dazzle the bats.

It is crucial for humans to always strive to become one with Suksma Sejati, so that on their journey towards liberation, they are protected from all kinds of temptations, and they can reach the throne of Suksma Kawekas.

Being aware of the existence of Tripurusa must be trained every day, so that it becomes a natural characteristic, as if it were an inherent trait, and therefore, receives constant organic reinforcement. At every moment, wherever one may be, they must be aware of Tripurusa, such as when walking, sitting, eating, sleeping, and so on. Being aware of Tripurusa within oneself will gradually develop into the ability to differentiate between what is true and what is false, what is eternal and what is transient, what is subjective and what is objective. Whatever one does, they will not be forsaken by the high ability to discern, if they continuously and sincerely remain aware of Tripurusa until their moment of death.


Ad.2

Belief is the bond that connects humans with Tripurusa. Belief is the relationship that Suksma Sejati traverses to guide, protect, and nurture humans. If someone desires guidance from Suksma Sejati, then they must cultivate belief in Suksma Sejati within themselves. Hasn't Suksma Sejati been given to the Holy Spirit as its True Guide and Teacher? Disbelief severs the bond between humans and Suksma Sejati, and thus, the special power of Suksma Sejati cannot flow to humans. Firm belief is like the reins used by a coachman to control their horse, and belief will always bring someone back to the path protected by the True Teacher, so that they become united with Suksma Sejati.

Many people claim to believe in themselves. However, most of them do not truly understand what is meant by the self and how to strengthen belief in oneself. Most only recognize their physical self and consider it as the true and eternal guide. However, the essential self of humans is the Holy Spirit, one aspect of the Great Power of Life. Therefore, there is actually nothing that cannot be achieved by humans, as long as they sincerely unite with Suksma Sejati. For this reason, it is important for humans to strengthen their belief in Tripurusa and have the will to draw closer to Him. In doing so, that belief will become as strong as a mountain of steel.

Ad.3

Obedience is the channeling of our lives to align with the teachings of the True Teacher. All duties in society can be traced back to this one duty: to carry out tasks on behalf of Suksma Sejati. There is no obligation that is beneficial to humankind that does not contain the wisdom of Suksma Sejati. Therefore, each individual, according to their abilities and position, must fulfill their tasks wholeheartedly, even if those tasks may seem insignificant from a societal perspective. Humans should not hope to be given great tasks. Great tasks are rare and they come as a logical consequence of consistently and diligently performing many small tasks well.

No one should consider a task assigned to them as trivial, no matter how insignificant it may seem. Everyone has their own responsibilities and their own position. The life of society is the collaboration of thousands of individuals. No one can live without the help of fellow humans. The essence of obedience is to wholeheartedly dedicate oneself to every action, no matter how small or lowly, and to carry it out with awareness and belief in Suksma Sejati.

That is TRISILA as the main guiding principle for humans on how they should live.

The five virtues that individuals should cultivate within themselves in order to effectively practice Trisila are called Pancasila, which consists of the following (in Javanese terminology):
1. Rila (Sincerity)
2. Narima (Acceptance)
3. Temen (Cooperation)
4. Sabar (Patience)
5. Budi luhur (Noble character)

### PANCA SILA

#### 1. Rila (sincerity). 

(Willing, ready to sacrifice, ready to let go)

Rila is a state of mind in which a person is not attached or overly dependent on the worldly things that can be damaged and change, because they are truly aware that everything is contained within the Power of the Supreme Self. All possessions must be able to be released without causing pain in the heart. One must be able to accept every situation and fate in life without thinking of oneself, such as losing family members, possessions, and status. Rila is the non-attachment of the self to things that can be damaged, but it does not mean neglecting responsibilities, feeling tired of life, or being indifferent.

To cultivate the virtue of rila, one must learn to always act selflessly and be willing to help others, in accordance with the ethics and norms outlined in the teachings of the True Master. By consistently practicing rila, gradually one attains absolute freedom from the ego's bondage to the material world, both coarse and subtle.

To cultivate the virtue of rila, one must learn to always act selflessly and be willing to help others, in accordance with the etiquette and manners outlined in the teachings of the True Master. By consistently practicing rila, gradually one attains absolute freedom from the ego's bondage to the material world, both coarse and subtle.


#### 2. Narima (Acceptance)

Narima is closely related to the balance of the soul, but it is not the passive and work-avoidant attitude of someone who dislikes working. The problem lies in accepting what one receives in life. What one receives as a duty must be carried out willingly, without a desire to quickly be free from it.

Narima is not desiring the possessions of others and not being envious of others' happiness. Therefore, a person with such qualities is a happy person. Narima is an inexhaustible wealth. It also enhances the ability to possess. Whoever wants to be wealthy should seek it within narima. Life is the ebb and flow of values and norms, and those who accept it stand above the ups and downs of life, and therefore they are happy. They can have a lot of material wealth without exceeding their capacity. If a person cannot achieve or obtain something, they must face the situation with a narima attitude. Even if they cannot achieve everything, some things have already been accomplished.

Only narima frees a person from the constraints of a dark soul and illuminates the heart, keeping them away from the waves of materialism. If a person finds themselves in a situation without clarity and without a visible way out, the path they must take is obedience to the True Guru.

#### 3. Temen (Honesty, love for truth, sincere).

Temen carries the meaning of obliging oneself to fulfill promises made, whether spoken or held in the heart, as they are equally important. Promises made verbally must be honored, as they are witnessed by others. A person who fails to keep their promises actually undermines their own credibility. The only difference is that promises made verbally can be seen by others, while those held in the heart are known only to oneself.

Temen leads us to justice, and justice brings stability, inner strength, tranquility, and enhances credibility. No religion can be practiced without temen. A person cannot be purified if their tongue is not pure. The practice of temen should not be influenced by considerations of personal gain or loss. Even if one may suffer losses, the concept of gain or loss does not exist in the nature of temen. Whoever lacks temen cannot receive the Grace of the Supreme Self. A foolish person who keeps their promises is more valuable than an intelligent person whose words cannot be trusted. Whoever keeps their promises in their words and acts in accordance with truth will eventually be able to perfect their character and thereby experience the truth. Whoever wishes to follow the True Guru must cultivate the virtue of always keeping their promises.

#### 4. Sabar (Patience, tolerance, perseverance)

Patience is one of the most important virtues that a person can possess. Every religion promotes patience. Patience is the capacity to endure and accept various trials in life. Patience is not the characteristic of a person who gives up easily. On the contrary, patience is the trait of someone who is strong in their perseverance to achieve something, broad in their perspective, and not narrow-minded. It can be likened to an ocean of wisdom that can contain everything within it, where all rivers converge, without the possibility of overflowing at any time.

For those who wish to develop this virtue within themselves, they should start with the characteristic of not having a narrow-minded view, not easily getting angry, and not seeking self-promotion. One should not be limited by their own knowledge. One must free themselves from their own knowledge and respect other religions and beliefs. Other beliefs and religions are just as valuable as one's own. If one compares the beauty of one religion to another, the comparison does not touch on essential matters. Every religion shows the path to reach God, just as one's own belief does. It is good to familiarize oneself with other religions in order to broaden one's perspective and be able to help others appropriately when needed.

The value of patience is like a very bitter herbal medicine that can only be taken by those with strong character. Only those with a strong soul can withstand accepting opinions that differ from their own. Our own outlook on life has also evolved from insignificant and incomplete understandings.

If one forgets how their own soul used to be, they cannot help and support others in gaining a deeper understanding. Therefore, humans must love and care for their fellow humans, just as they love and care for their closest family members. All difficult efforts are made easier by patience. Patience leads us to our goals and aspirations. Patience is not a stagnant quality that stops at a certain level of understanding and expectation, but an active trait that perseveres and diligently commands the implementing tools until the goal is achieved.

#### 5 Budi Luhur (Noble character).

Budi luhur can be translated as noble character. Budi represents the state of brightness as the attribute of Suksma Sejati (True Self). Budi is the illumination that humans need. The illumination of Suksma Sejati is captured by the mind, which can be seen as a bridge between Tripurusa and the physical body. Therefore, the mind has two aspects, light and dark. The mind is light or illuminated when it receives the illumination from Tripurusa, and it becomes dark when it only directs itself towards the material, filled with desires and cravings.

Directing oneself towards and aligning with Tripurusa requires mastery of the physical body. This mastery is achieved through practicing PANCASILA. Through this path, humans can become a pathway or intermediary for the realization of the Will of Suksma Kawekas through the wisdom of the planning of Suksma Sejati. True leaders and teachers.

Luhur represents the attribute of Suksma Kawekas, which constantly radiates its Great Power through Suksma Sejati. Budi luhur implies that humans strive to possess qualities that will bring them closer to Tripurusa, such as love for fellow humans, purity, justice, without discrimination of high or low status, poor or rich, while still adhering to moral values in social interactions, selfless generosity, willingness to help materially, physically, and spiritually, and if necessary, even risking their lives.

However, these qualities should not be practiced blindly, but rather with wisdom that grows from obedience to the teachings of the True Guru. These qualities should not be accepted and implemented superficially, as they would not align with the Will of Suksma Kawekas. The nature of Budi luhur cannot be fully understood if the other four virtue have not become ingrained.

### Prohibitions (4).

In the small book called Paliwara, there are mentioned five prohibitions that must be observed. The prohibitions are as follows:

#### I. Do not worship anyone other than Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati.

Do not worship anything other than Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati. People should not worship objects, idols, trees, graves, stones, celestial objects, natural phenomena, humans, or anyone or anything, except for Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati. Many people worship creatures that can only be observed in their imagination or believe in them, or those who whisper teachings that sometimes appear in their ears without revealing themselves, which can be perceived by the subtle senses or something that cannot be captured by the gross senses. This leads us astray because Suksma Kawekas cannot be captured in something limited, nor in our imagination.

Belief in auspicious and inauspicious days, amulets, mantras, and the like diminishes and eventually destroys belief in Suksma Kawekas.

If one worships Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati, do not depict or imagine any form or light. Life cannot be depicted in any form, no matter how subtle.

The essence of human beings is Tripurusa. By worshiping limited objects and creatures bound by space and time, we belittle Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati. Worshiping anything or anyone other than Suksma Kawekas is the greatest sin one can commit.

#### II. ** Be cautious with sensual desires.**


In this prohibition, it is emphasized that man is the path through which the Holy Spirit enters the woman's body, and this responsibility must always be respected as a gift from Suksma Kawekas. If a person wishes to fulfill their obligations towards Suksma Kawekas, they should not indulge in their sensual desires but use them in accordance with the social code of conduct.

Neglecting this prohibition can lead to physical and spiritual illnesses that may be passed down to future generations.

#### III. It is forbidden to consume food and drinks that can harm the body

The influence of harmful food and drinks on one's personality is significant, to the extent that it hinders one from fulfilling their obligations to Tripurusa, as stated in Trisila and Pancasila. This prohibition is not limited to just food and drinks but also includes all habits and pleasures that cause people to forget their moral conduct, such as gambling, cockfighting, and the like. In short, anything that harms the body and goes against the teachings of the True Guru is included in this prohibition.

#### IV. People are prohibited from violating the laws of the country in which they reside.

This prohibition is explained based on the belief that government officials and employees are merely representatives of Suksma Kawekas tasked with governing and leading, and they are the representatives of peace and social order. However, some of them abuse their power for personal gain. Suksma Kawekas is aware of all these actions, and each individual will not escape fair punishment, but it is not the duty of individuals to be their own judges. There are existing mechanisms to examine individuals regarding their responsibilities and to enforce the law when necessary. Certain individuals may evade their obligations to the state in such a clever way that the laws are unable to prosecute the violations. However, because Suksma Kawekas is All-Knowing and Just, no one will escape from His fair judgment. All suffering and disasters that occur in the world serve as a reminder to humans of their obligations to Sukma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati, the Eternal Messenger.

#### V. Avoid all conflicts.

Because the human soul is the Holy Spirit, which is the same in every individual and originates from the same Source, engaging in quarrels, obstructing one another, and depriving each other of prosperity are not desirable traits for humans. Any tendency to harm or destroy one another brings humans closer to gods, which means violating the first prohibition. If individuals scrutinize their own mistakes, they will realize there are so many that there is no time left to see the faults of others. Their own mistakes must be transformed into qualities that align with Trisila and Pancasila to uphold our humanity. If this is accomplished, the True Spirit will guide humans to avoid dangers and missteps, ultimately leading to unity with Life.

### GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

#### Jalan Rahayu (Path of Salvation (5))

As a guide, the fundamental principles of implementation are provided in the small book "Jalan Rahayu" (The Path of Salvation). The Jalan Rahayu consists of five chapters, which can serve as steps in elevating one's consciousness in accordance with Hastasila (Trisila combined with Pancasila - Hastasila hasta - 8).

These five chapters represent the obligations of individuals to embark on their journey by embracing the Syahadat, which encompasses the three moral values of Trisila, and adopting the five moral values of Pancasila to integrate them into their personal virtues (watak).

Before accepting this candramanusia (human nature), one may have been bound to a way of life that deviates from the teachings of the True Guru, as mentioned in Hastasila. Their approach to life, how and where they embrace the world, might differ from what candramanusia entails. Therefore, individuals may find themselves contemplating how to start anew. Having good intentions and courage alone may not be sufficient for some to initiate a change in life's direction. The pivotal point of this change lies in reevaluating one's approach to life and making specific guiding principles a part of their own identity. The five chapters are as follows:

1. Understand and internalize the essence of the Syahadat, as it serves as the foundation of belief and the guiding direction that must be followed with consistency.

2. Practice devotion (ibadat) to Suksma Kawekas and His Messengers, strengthened by the act of panembah (prayer), to deepen one's experience and consciously realize the existence of Tripurusa.

3. Embrace love for fellow manubia (human beings) by embodying the virtues of generosity and helpfulness, aiding others in relieving their sufferings according to their needs and the capacity of the one offering help, with the purpose of purifying oneself.

4. Exercise control over desires directed towards evil and unwanted aspects, ensuring that they do not disrupt one's journey and the fulfillment of their responsibilities.

5. Attain and attain a noble state of enlightenment, which can be used as a preparation to achieve the true purpose of life.

Ad 1.

Syahadat is the consciousness of the Holy Spirit within Tripurusa, which is the essential core of human existence. Before the Holy Spirit took on a material covering, Tripurusa already existed as the immaterial Life. The presence of the Holy Spirit within Tripurusa, when viewed from the starting point of humans, is known as consciousness. Within this consciousness, the Holy Spirit only recognizes Suksma Kawekas as the Origin of Life and Suksma Sejati as its dynamic aspect, which the Holy Spirit must traverse to rediscover its Source

Let us repeat the translation of Syahadat here in the form of a statement:

>"Suksma Kawekas is the true devotion of servants, and Suksma Sejati is the true Messenger of Suksma Kawekas, namely the Guide and Teacher of true servants.

>Only Suksma Kawekas personally rules over all realms and their contents, and only Suksma Sejati personally guides all servants.

>All power, which is the power of Suksma Kawekas, is in the hands of Suksma Sejati, and all servants are under the dominion of Suksma Sejati."

The syahadat is an existential experience of the existence of Tripurusa, which is absolutely independent of anything, with the ability to dominate all that exists in material form, without being bound by anything material. This consciousness of the Holy Spirit is not experienced in a material sense and is not bound in a material way, unlike the reflection of Tripurusa, which is the mind in the broadest sense, which also has self-consciousness and consciousness of existence, bound in a material way, namely in the form of certain organs. Therefore, the consciousness of the Holy Spirit in Tripurusa is not known alongside the consciousness of the mind, which is organic and accompanied by a sense of satisfaction. The mind must first be eradicated in order to experience the syahadat. In other words, consciousness of Tripurusa is not at the level of organic consciousness, but humans can also experience this consciousness of Tripurusa if they are no longer bound by their organic consciousness. Tripurusa has an influence on organic consciousness,  but conversely, it is not the case.

Although the Holy Spirit is one with Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati, humans are not Suksma Kawekas or Suksma Sejati.

If a person is not aware of Tripurusa within themselves, then they have not truly reached their development. What they have developed are only physical abilities of the physical and subtle organs, such as imagination and feelings.

The Syahadat becomes the power of belief and the channel through which the Love and Blessings of Tripurusa flow into the human heart. If imagination is directed towards worldly matters, then the material world seems to stand between humans and Tripurusa, blocking the flow of Love and Blessings. The Syahadat arouses the intention of humans to practice Trisila and Pancasila. Therefore, humans must always remain inseparable from Tripurusa in their thoughts and feelings, and must always remind themselves that each human has Tripurusa within themselves.

Ad.2

Worship (ibadah) is the obligation of every human being towards Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati, and it serves as a practice for the imagination, feelings, and desires to align themselves towards one point, which is Tripurusa. Is the act of Panembah (prayer) present in the Indonesian human character? Panembah is an activity to emphasize the awareness that the Supreme Being exists and resides in the heart of every individual, and that the Supreme Being is an absolute necessity as a guide in the process of liberation, where the intention to leave behind old ways of living and align with the teachings of the True Guru is carried out.

All the harmful weeds in the heart must be weeded out. The human heart must be pure and white like a blank sheet of paper, so that the panorama of Suksma Sejati can be received without obstruction, without being clouded by prejudices. Weeds obstruct the free entry of the panorama of Suksma Sejati into the human heart. The panorama will show the way in the process of becoming one with Life.

Therefore, Panembah (prayer) is essential as a support for the awareness of the existence of Tripurusa, strengthened by belief and practiced with obedience. Obedience means that humans train their physical bodies by following such regulations that align the imagination, feelings, and desires with the teachings of Suksma Sejati.

The vital centers thus create a spiritual climate within our personalities, which progressively approaches the consciousness of Tripurusa. When the spiritual climate is aligned with the consciousness of Tripurusa, the time comes for Tripurusa to manifest fully within the physical body. At this moment, the attachment of the "I" to the body transforms into a relationship. This transformation can be temporary or permanent, depending on the presence or absence of tendencies to attach oneself to the external world, represented in the physical body by impressions of feelings and thoughts. Worship can be schemed based on the hierarchical relationship between the physical body, the Holy Spirit, Sukema Sejati, and Suksma Kawekas. The nature of worship is determined by the distance or difference between two consecutive degrees. Therefore, from a schematic and hierarchical perspective, there are three degrees of worship, namely:

1. Worship of the Material I (Aku) to the Holy Spirit
2. Worship of the Holy Spirit to Suksma Sejati
3. Worship of Suksma Sejati to Suksma Kawekas

1. Worship of the Material I (Aku) to the Holy Spirit.

The difference between the Holy Spirit and the Material I (Aku) from the physical body is that the presence of the Holy Spirit is not bound by the material and its various aspects, such as honor, fame, reputation, tradition, power, and so on, while the Material I (Aku) is bound by all of these. Therefore, the worship of the Material I (Aku) must be directed towards transforming this bondage into a voluntary relationship, where unbinding responsibility and love connect the Holy Spirit and the physical body on one side with the surrounding world on the other side. This process can be called purification.

As mentioned above, the Material I (Aku) creates a climate that encompasses, on the one hand, the attitude towards the macrocosm and, on the other hand, the attitude towards Tripurusa. This climate is the result of the cooperation of the three vital centers of desire, feeling, and emotion. To change this climate, humans must work on and guide the activities of these centers towards Tripurusa. In this endeavor, the intellect is used to train and habituate desire to adapt to Pancasila and adhere to prohibitions. To carry out this training task, one must always remember Trisila. Changes arise in the person's way of life. What is said and done by the person are actions that can be perceived by the senses, carried out to elevate the purpose of their worship, which is Suksma Kawekas. These actions can be considered as etiquette towards Suksma Kawekas, just as in daily life, people must also observe etiquette towards their country's leaders. However, if the mind does not participate in these rituals, then there will arise symptoms that coincide with simulation or hypocrisy. The content of their intellect does not match their actions. Therefore, it is crucial for the intellect to be used to recite and remember the attributes of Suksma Kawekas, such as Maha Asih (Great Love), Maha Murah (Great Generosity), Maha Adil (Supreme Justice), Maha Kuasa (Supreme Power).

What is remembered must be reinforced by language and actions in that worship. If only the imagination alone performs the worship and the implementing tools do not participate, it means that the person succumbs to a weak nature that seeks ease, and therefore, their worship does not receive organic reinforcement.

In the worship of Aku-materiil to Roh Suci, it is crucial to choose the object of our actions carefully and align our language with Trisila and Pancasila, while shifting the focus of our life orientation from external worldly pursuits to deep introspection within oneself. Turning inward does not mean completely turning away from the outside world and isolating oneself in intrapsychic life. Instead, it signifies that the emergence of the self (AKU) will be accompanied by responsibility and compassion towards fellow human beings, which will grow stronger over time.

This transformation is a personal climate change, where the functions of imagination, feeling, and desire remain intact but have undergone training and conditioning to bring forth their positive aspects. A conversion within one's inner self occurs, and egoistic, lazy, cruel, deceitful tendencies, and sensual indulgence turn into attributes of physical strength, tolerance, and resilience against shortcomings. The innate ability to drive oneself remains, but only the object and direction of that drive change. This is the mechanism of sublimation in the Indonesian psyche. The lauwamah has experienced training, so its positive aspects come to the forefront.

To facilitate this conversion, the mobilization of sufi (laya) love is utilized. For training, individuals select and create specific conditions that make the process easier (dressuurnya). It is evident that external circumstances cannot be disregarded as long as there are attachments. In fact, these external factors can stimulate and reinforce the intention to practice worship to Suksma Kawekas.

Individuals choose and create special places and times for the purpose of panembah. The words used in panembah are carefully selected to always inspire activity.

1. Awareness of the existence of Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati, by remembering their attributes such as the Most High, All-Powerful, Just, and Merciful.

2. Belief in the Supreme Power of Suksma Kawekas over the universe, which is entrusted to Suksma Sejati, the True Guide and Teacher. This Supreme Power can be observed and felt by humans in the objects of the world that cannot be created by human hands.

3. Obedience to practice the essence of syahadat and fulfill the promises as spiritual beings, such as practicing Pancasila and adhering to prohibitions.

During panembah, a psychic climate is created in which the three vital centers work together in harmony. After panembah is finished, the climate doesn't immediately vanish. It continues to encompass the soul until it creates another climate. The distinctive panembah climate can be achieved during panembah itself or even before, during the preparation for panembah.

Through practice, the vital centers seem to naturally merge into one integrated force before the panembah ceremony commences. Sometimes, the climate of devotion cannot be attained, especially if a person cannot release from their mind the everyday problems of life. The external world participates when a person enters panembah because the world preserved in their mind (thoughts, feelings, likes, and dislikes) has gained authority and thus compels the person to become its slave.

Therefore, it is crucial to free oneself first from all daily concerns before starting panembah. Even if someone seeks to find a solution to a difficulty through panembah, that problem must be forgotten during the ceremony. Otherwise, one cannot distance oneself from the difficulty during panembah. Panembah is the path to enter the atmosphere of Tripurusa's existence. And here, there are no thoughts, feelings, or desires. The three vital centers still function, so our minds still display various shadows and processes, and our feelings still contain emotions, while desires still generate wishes, preventing the person performing panembah from reaching the atmosphere of Tripurusa's existence.

Humans must train themselves to enter their inner selves more deeply and become accustomed to the state of emptiness and solitude, where the use of senses (including the subtle ones) does not disturb. Within ourselves, at the gateway of Tripurusa, there is a sensory threshold where there is awareness without sensing the existence of the physical body, thus not confined by physical aspects. One does not feel within the body but rather perceives being in an unbounded state.

The words of panembah, the attitude, and the environment have been necessary to guide the vital centers towards the state of existence previously described. Indeed, this immersion is a courageous act, as the next step is to render the centers unnecessary themselves. This means facing a problem that demands sacrificing one's own existence without receiving something in return, which has been known in the state of existence of those centers. Because Tripurusa is immaterial, while those three centers are bound by matter and require the senses to gain experience. During panembah, one must strive not to form any images of Tripurusa or anyone else.

Awareness of Tripurusa can be achieved without creating any mental images. The floating thoughts and images during panembah should be disregarded without attaching any feelings to them. In this way, the contents of the mind are subjectivized, and thus their power is eliminated. However, sometimes when a person reaches the state of Tripurusa's existence during panembah, which is unfamiliar to them, they may then desire to return to their familiar everyday psychological state. As soon as this desire arises, they will return to their original state of mind.

In the state of Tripurusa, one should not attempt to recall the remaining phrases of worship, as they are not yet completed. It is possible that one may be drawn into the state of Tripurusa before the worship is finished. Worldly attachments are not necessarily unpleasant, as some people claim. However, these attachments must be recognized and felt as burdensome if one wishes to practice freeing oneself from them.

The release of the centers of life initially occurs suddenly. Before one realizes it, they are already in the state of Tripurusa. This state is similar to the state of consciousness between sleep and wakefulness, like the twilight between day and night. This is the state of Rahsa Jati.

In the work "Wedotomo" by Wiryokusumo (6), it is sung as the opening of the veil (in the sense of the mind): "..." (continuation of the lyrics).

- Pambukaning warana - Terbukanya selubung
- tarlen saking - is none other than
- liyep layaping aluyut - in the state between sleep and wakefulness
- pinda pesating supena - by the disappearance of thoughts
- sumusup ing Rahsa Jati - entering into Rahsa Jati.

Worship creates an atmosphere, which can be likened to an oasis in the desert of uncontrolled desires. This unique atmosphere expands as worship is intensified in frequency and intensity, encompassing not only the worshipper but also those around them. The centers of vitality, therefore, operate in accordance with that atmosphere.

Lauwamah reveals its good aspect. This atmosphere expands and persists. The oasis expands and transforms the desert into a beautiful garden. The state of the Holy Spirit is achieved. In this state, humans have freed themselves from material attachments, worldly bonds, and their own physical bodies. Humans have been perfectly purified; they have triumphed over themselves by sacrificing their ego. If this state becomes permanent, no longer disturbed by desires of a physical nature, then the allure of the world disappears immediately. The allure of the world exists only as long as humans feel attracted to it. If humans no longer feel attracted, then the allure of the world vanishes for them. Now, humans direct themselves towards Sang Guru Sejati (True Essence) and begin the worship of the Holy Spirit to Sang Guru Sejati.

II. ***Worship of the Holy Spirit to Suksma Sejati***.

The worship of the Holy Spirit to Suksma Sejati is determined by the difference between Suksma Sejati and the Holy Spirit. Both are immaterial, but the distinction lies in the limitations of the Holy Spirit, which is limited to humanity, while Suksma Sejati is limitless. Suksma Sejati is the life that gives life to all living beings.

Since desire is controlled by the Holy Spirit, worship at this level no longer requires ceremonies, and the worshipper is no longer bound by place and time.

The Holy Spirit allows itself to be guided by Suksma Sejati, without its own will, without questioning how and why the ebb and flow occur in its life. Presenting problems that show rational activity is no longer used to orient oneself in life. What exists is the absolute acceptance of duty and destiny, with the sole motive of being led back to the pure Source by Suksma Sejati. The Holy Spirit is in the middle point of all polar aspects of the physical realm. In this motionless surrender, the Holy Spirit is received into Suksma Sejati, and the disciple becomes the Master, as stated in the Quran: "Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi roji'un."

***III. Worship of Suksma Sejati to Suksma Kawekas.***

The worship of Suksma Sejati to Suksma Kawekas is the worship of noble-minded humans in the essence of the Indonesian inner soul. The difference between Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati lies in the nature of Stillness, Static, and Movement, which are Dynamic.

In the worship of Suksma Sejati to Suksma Kawekas, wisdom and power are surrendered back to the owner. The human who has reached the level of Suksma Sejati becomes the True Leader and Teacher of humanity. They also become a warrior for all living beings, until eventually they, as Suksma Kawekas, realize their presence in every object and encompass the entire universe.

Due to the intensity of their devotion, basic needs such as sleep, food, and drink become unnoticed. In this ultimate point, which was once the starting point, the Will is born from within itself. This is the Source of Life, which gives life to all living beings and creates matter to serve as a vessel for Life.

If we return to the structure of humans as spiritual beings with vital centers as forming factors, based on this structure, we can also classify certain types of worship, namely worship of desire, sensation, imagination, and Rahsa Jati. This is the most suitable division of worship for humans based on their individual typological nature.

Worship of desire consists of developing good qualities alongside the practice of mastering the qualities of the letters (dressage). Its practical implementation consists of practicing the rules of life and ethics towards society (Pancasila) and towards Tripurusa (Trisila) in a way that cannot be perceived by the senses. In addition to training in mastering good qualities, humans must also train themselves to use asmara-sufi (-laya), which is a combination of mutmainah (tranquility) with desire (sufiah). Desires must be directed towards wanting to unite with Tripurusa, and one's will must provide strength and perseverance to that desire.

The object of activity selection needs to be changed. People still differentiate between commands and prohibitions in social life, distinguish between good and bad, sins and non-sins, appropriate and inappropriate, and so on.

Through the worship of desire to Tripurusa, gradually a stage is reached where those values no longer apply, and the attitude towards life changes from questioning what is done to questioning how one acts. The selection of objects that give rise to problems in current life is no longer necessary. The problem lies in the observation and enlightenment of the subject. The subject now becomes the object. At this level, the external world as a problem no longer holds significance. The problem has shifted to one's own life and vital centers.

At this stage of development, there is still physical activity and growth. However, the execution of these functions gradually ceases to be a problem. Thus, the level of "heneng" (silence) is achieved, awaiting what is to come, surrendering to the death of the self.

The next level is Liberation from the material and, simultaneously, the elevation of Merajat as a Human Being. Sensation-based worship is an effort to create a spiritual atmosphere that lies between positive and negative sensations.

Positive sensation contains the nature of wanting to possess and bring closer to oneself that which is the cause of the positive sensation. If possible, one wants to identify oneself with that cause. Negative sensation is characterized by rejection, neglect, and distancing oneself from the cause of the negative sensation.

The neutral stance in sensation-based worship is located at the midpoint between all opposing polar forces. There is no acceptance or rejection, no determination of value such as beauty and ugliness, good and bad, high and low, intelligent and foolish, virtuous and unvirtuous. Positive and negative emotions indicate a connection with the surrounding world and therefore can be considered as suffering.

Through this path of neutrality, humans reach a higher level of indifference, which points towards Justice, as they are able to stand above all changes and impermanence of life, which gradually leads to Liberation from suffering in this world.

In the worship of imagination, it should be focused on the level of merging the sovereignty of the self with aligning the functioning of imagination with the existence of Absolute and undisturbed Sovereignty, which fully encompasses the sovereignty of the self.

In practice, this is implemented by always remembering the Supreme Power of Tripurusa, who governs the universe based on the law of justice and that humans exist within that Supreme Power. All humans possess a Sacred Spirit, so every individual is essentially equal to others and no one has a higher position or more rights towards Suksma Kawekas and Suksma Sejati.

Imagination is a reflection of Pripurusa. With the disappearance of self-sovereignty, the function of imagination also disappears. This means that in practice, imagination is no longer utilized. The practice of not using imagination occurs during panembah. During panembah, humans train themselves not to form shadows in their minds.

Cipta, as a reflection of the Sacred Spirit, is the function of forming shadows in imagination. During panembah, consciousness develops to overcome the function of imagination in forming these shadows. The reflection of the Sacred Spirit is called back by the original source of that reflection, or in other words, humans can continue living without using cipta.

The above sequence can also be depicted in another way, namely that in the process of Liberation, the components that form imagination are obstacles that must be overcome.

Between the physical body and the Sacred Spirit, there stands cipta and pangaribawa as the reflection and weapon of the Sacred Spirit, which must be used to control the physical body.

Between the Sacred Spirit and Suksma Sejati, there is nalar with prabawa, the reflection of Suksma Sejati. And between Suksma Sejati and Suksma Kawekas, there is pangerti and kemayan, the reflection of Suksma Kawekas, which must be mastered by Suksma Sejati in order to reach Suksma Kawekas.

Humans who want to be free from attachment to the material must train themselves to eliminate the function of forming shadows. The function of forming shadows causes humans to see the world in shapes and colors that correspond to the shadows formed in their minds. They tend to see life according to their specific assumptions, based on their identity, traditions, and specific prejudices. However, life cannot be captured in a single specific form. Therefore, humans must free themselves from their prejudices, traditions, and rigid assumptions.

Cipta works by giving form, and the use of cipta strengthens human sovereignty. However, humans who live outside the function of cipta accept what they encounter in the external world as it is, without selective judgment. Due to this attitude, their sovereignty gradually disappears.

Humans who have reached the level of the Sacred Spirit have the opportunity to master nalar with prabawa. Presenting issues is the result of the work of nalar. However, questions about how and why in life, and choosing a specific lifestyle for oneself, are abandoned. Humans avoid the law of cause and effect known as Karma. They strive not to create Karma, even though they know how to live happily without focusing on material aspects.

If a human is united with Suksma Sejati, they will stand outside of Karma. Whatever they do, whether good or bad in the eyes of others, does not create Karma consequences.

In the transition from Suksma Sejati to Suksma Kawekas, pangerti must be mastered. The function of humans as the True Teacher and Leader, which is the warrior in the world, is abandoned to return to the Original Existence, where initially, Ideas and Wisdom were not yet born.

The worship of Rahsa Jati is the worship of humans who have reached the level of the Sacred Spirit. The worship of the Sacred Spirit has been explained above.

All these stages, both in hierarchical and structural aspects, are merely orientations for our rational attitude. The human personality does not have a fixed point of balance. Its center of gravity fluctuates and the degree of its existence changes. Therefore, it is not possible to determine definite lines of development and fixed rules. Each individual must determine their own path through introspection and comparing themselves to the ideal image, in order to come to a conclusion about what is best for them, based on a self-assessment that is not too high and not too low.

Thus, the path to liberation remains open for each individual's typological nature. Each person has their own hopes and possibilities. There is no path that is closer or farther away. The closest path is determined by one's willingness to sacrifice their self to the Greater Self.

Ad.3

Compassion and willingness to help based on love for fellow human beings is the best translation of the meaning of Budidarma. Budidarma is the characteristic of humans who like to help those around them in their difficulties. Budidarma is the right way for humans to purify themselves. Only pure feelings that are generated through Budidarma can make prayers meaningful. The purpose of self-purification through Budidarma is to ensure that the process of liberation continues. This purification strengthens faith.

Feelings must always be kept pure, because it is the purity that seemingly supports the promise to Tripurusa. Only in pure feelings can honesty and love for truth develop, which allows humans to see the essence of things, have sharp discernment, and not be clouded by desires that serve self-interest.

Helping fellow human beings is not the monopoly of the rich, and receiving assistance is not limited to the poor, because charity can be given not only in the form of money or goods but also in the form of energy or advice. Even the poor can perform charity. Every human being can find themselves in a situation where they need assistance, in whatever form and from whoever.

Charity must be in accordance with the needed requirements and should not exceed the capacity of the helper, with the understanding that the helper should not be disturbed in their social obligations because of their assistance. The amount to be given in charity should be determined based on one's own ability. The nature of the assistance also depends on the circumstances. Anything beyond one's own needs according to a decent standard of living can be given in charity. The wealthy can donate material possessions, the knowledgeable can give advice, and the physically strong can assist with their physical strength.

But if a person does not understand "narima" (contentment), they will not be able to feel that they "have enough for themselves and their family." Therefore, their feelings cannot contain the essence of honesty and trust, even if they have the intention to seek and find that essence. Thus, they will not be able to reach proper devotion because their feelings are impure, and because they do not purify themselves, their charity, which is still driven by forced rules, does not arise from their own heartfelt intentions and is not yet perfect, even though it is beneficial and praiseworthy.

The qualities of Tripurusa must always be remembered by humans, to serve as a guide in the formation of their character, so that they become part of our inner voice, which shows the way and encourages us to purify ourselves. Rules and regulations of charity are merely aids and guidelines for humans to follow, until they no longer need the limitations of rules because they already know the direction to be taken, which is to become one with the Most Merciful through self-purification.

Giving assistance without any ulterior motives, such as seeking fame or expecting favors in return, is in accordance with the Will of "Suksma Kawekas" (the Divine Essence). Offerings that come from a pure heart must be accepted, as long as they do not cause difficulties. If the gift is considered more beneficial for someone else, it is better to pass it on to them.

Helping others should not just be a superficial act to fulfill formalities, but should be a genuine practice of love for fellow human beings, so that humans can understand and experience the singular and undivided nature of Life, and in doing so, truly witness the Syahadat (testimony) with sincerity.

Ad 4

Because within the physical body there are desires, which by nature tend to move towards "bad" things, humans must introspect to not let these desires go unchecked. All desires, whether "good" or "bad," are the energy of the physical body that provides the ability for the body to carry out the commands of the Holy Spirit in the framework of the Will of Suksma Kawekas, and also to achieve what we personally desire. Therefore, one should not neglect their coarse physical body; on the contrary, the coarse physical body should be well-maintained.

Mind controls desires. If desires are likened to the path of a river, then the mind is the water. Humans can dam the river and not let the water flow freely, but rather redirect it through a new path that is beneficial for humans and in harmony with the Will of Suksma Kawekas. Initially, the path of the river also occurs due to the "choice" of the flowing water, like a river in the mountains that flows swiftly into the valley and chooses its path based on the existing terrain, thus following the natural flow of water.

Imagination changes the course of desires by always thinking in a certain direction. This method is initially difficult to implement and accompanied by negative feelings, but over time, those feelings gradually become positive, and the direction and atmosphere of thought leave an impression, causing desires to be controlled. This habit becomes the second nature.

The formation and transformation of character begin with imagination. Therefore, one must start by censoring their thoughts and directing them towards specific qualities, namely the qualities of Tripurusa.

The will that arises from desire is called "karep," while the will of Tripurusa is called "karsa." The emergence of karsa is not bound by any condition. Karep is always accompanied or followed by thoughts or understanding in the mind.

The control of desires only applies to desires that are not in accordance with the teachings of Suksma Sejati. Sufi desires must be trained to desire good things. If this training is difficult because bad habits have deeply ingrained, then control should be facilitated by reducing eating, drinking, sleeping, and sexual desires. The reduction of these basic needs should only be as much as necessary to remain fully aware of one's efforts without harming one's health. Because the body's duty is to lead humans towards their goals. Therefore, fasting (in any form) is always a tool to achieve goals and should not be reduced to mere ceremony or become the main objective, leading people to fast just for the sake of fasting.

Tapabrata is a powerful weapon to release attachment to material things, as long as it is done correctly. The measure is determined by wisdom, which is obtained by carefully practicing Trisila. Tapabrata in any form is not fully effective if it is still bound by regulations. Tapabrata must arise from inner needs, without being accompanied by any worldly expectations, such as power, wealth, honor, authority, and supernatural abilities. It is meaningless to withdraw to a secluded place and practice austerity there, to isolate oneself and thus avoid the obligation to help humanity find a path and a form of living together, which is characterized by mutual understanding and empathy.

Ad. 5

The level of consciousness that focuses on Rahsa Jati is the beginning of Budiluhur. At the core level of consciousness, there is a psychic climate, where humans have fully mastered the qualities of acceptance, patience, honesty, and willingness. They understand and can practice the Syahadat, making devotion their way of life, and treating the outside world with love and fairness, without distinguishing between individuals. This is the stage where humans have reached the final step of merging with Suksma Sejati and no longer need their imagination to control their physical body.

The shift of focus to Tripurusa occurs because reflection is drawn back, releasing its grip on the physical body, including imagination. This does not mean that the physical body is neglected, but rather that humans free themselves from their tendency to be attached to material things. The functioning of imagination can also be interpreted as an indication of an inclination to be attached (affinity) to worldly matters. If imagination disappears, there is nothing left to hinder humans from merging. However, when that will happen depends on the Will of Suksma Kawekas. The matter of merging can also be seen from the starting point of the return journey of Tritunggal, namely Tripurusa, becoming Dwitunggal (Suksma Kawekas - Suksma Sejati), and ultimately becoming the Supreme Being (Suksma Kawekas).

A human who is no longer influenced by imagination and desires attains the qualities of Suksma Sejati.

If we examine the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, its essence is the self-sacrifice of Suksma Kawekas. This self-sacrifice encompasses the entire process of liberation, starting from the sacrifice of material-consciousness-SELF to the complete surrender of Suksma Sejati to Suksma Kawekas. This absolute sacrifice is something immanent that surpasses all our understanding. Therefore, the elevated state of Budiluhur achieved after humans fully practice Trisila, Pancasila, and their implementing regulations is something that transcends any rationalization.

Obedience is the beginning of temen (honesty), temen helps to cultivate narima (acceptance), narima leads to sabar (patience), and sabar guides humans towards rela (willingness). Thus, this level of willingness becomes ingrained in us, and only then can we enter the state of Budiluhur.

## Chapter VII About The God (Dewa)

About dewa or jawata is written by Soenarto et al. in the book "Gumelaring Dumadi" (The Process of Creation) and "Tunggal Sabda" (The Same Utterance). The main content of this chapter is mostly taken from both books.

Dewa is a Suksma Kawekas being, which exists between humans and animals. Their bodies consist of the element of fire and they also live wherever there is fire. According to Indonesian metaphysics, the universe consists of the coarse-material and fine-material parts. The coarse-material part is also called the earth, like in humans, and consists of seven layers. Similarly, the fine-material part has seven layers and is also called the sky.

These layers, analogous to the human physical body, are not arranged in a hierarchy, but each one is a concentration that can all occupy the same space at the same time. The element of fire is found everywhere, permeating and penetrating the earth and sky, just like the other elements. Therefore, dewa can "reside" anywhere, whether in the air, water, or land. Their bodies do not have a fixed form and cannot be harmed, severed, or cut.

Dewa has a personal ego. Their consciousness comes from kemayan or maya, which is the same as the physical consciousness of humans. Dewa does not have the Holy Spirit as an essential part like in humans. Similarly, they are not given True Suksma as the True Guide to accompany them.

Because of their kemayan, dewa has special power and strength. So, dewa is purely material and can be compared to a battery that is given a specific energy charge. The kemayan of dewa gradually diminishes over time and eventually disappears, just like a battery that slowly becomes empty. Their physical body then returns to the element of fire in the universe. Therefore, they have a limited lifespan. The lifespan of dewa is a thousand times longer than that of humans. If the lifespan of a human is, for example, 60 years, then the lifespan of dewa is 60,000 years. Their numbers are multiplied many times over the number of humans. They are divided into various levels of power with a hierarchical relationship based on the difference in their kemayan strength. They also form groups and live together based on their character traits and living conditions. Dewa who live in the air, water, and land each form their own society with a kind of king, government, and subjects.

There are two major groups, the good group and the evil group. The good group includes the Wisnu group, also called Sura. The evil group includes the Kala group, also called Asura. These two groups are always at war. The dewa, because of their kemayan power, are aware of the intricacies of life around them, but their consciousness does not go beyond the condition of material existence, which can also be achieved through our thoughts. The dewa who have a large kemayan have immense power and influence over all things material. Because of their extraordinary power, they consider themselves the highest beings in life and feel that they rule the universe.

Although some of those in the Wisnu group are aware of the existence of Suksma Kawekas, they do not acknowledge Suksma Kawekas as the Supreme Being, precisely because of their nature of feeling the highest. Their sovereignty is so great that their knowledge of Suksma Kawekas as the Source of Life does not affect their sovereignty at all. They cannot do anything else except acknowledge themselves as a power that cannot be overcome by any other power. This nature is inherent in their sovereignty itself.

The Kala group refuses to acknowledge Suksma Kawekas as the Source of Life, and they always strive to eradicate the Wisnu group. Because of this, they are constantly at war. The sovereignty of these dewa causes them to desire worship, and for this purpose, they force the weaker dewa to become their followers, while the weaker ones seek protection from the powerful ones. In this way, they establish kingdoms. The powerful dewa live within the realm of fire with a concentration of subtle elements, while the subordinates live within denser concentrations.

There are seven hierarchical groups of power, and each group is further divided into seven sub-groups. The outline of this hierarchy, according to the book "Tunggal Sabda," is as follows:

I. The highest group is called "Luhur," who consider themselves as the supreme beings in the universe (material). They are symbolized by a three-pointed star with a blue center. This symbol is parallel to the concept of the Trinity and represents the authority of the king.

II. This group is called "Duta" (messengers), whose task is to relay the commands from the "Luhur" group. These commands have two aspects: 1) bringing life and creation, 2) destroying and merging. They are depicted by a four-pointed star, representing the shadow of the human physical body composed of four elements, receiving the utterance of Tripurusa. It has a green core in the center, symbolizing the support for the commands from the Luhur dewa.

III. This group is called "Wisesa" (having the right to decide) and is depicted by a five-pointed star with various colors, representing the shadow of the human senses, the tools humans use to interact with the external world. This group serves as the judiciary on behalf of the "Luhur" dewa, with a tendency to cause destruction to the subjects.

IV. This group is called "Hayu" (happy), who are tasked with carrying out commands on behalf of the "Luhur" dewa that are related to creation and giving life. The "Hayu" dewa are the bearers and executors of all things good. Their symbol is a six-pointed star, representing the shadow of Tripurusa along with its three reflections (pangaribawa, prabawa, and kemayan). Therefore, this group of dewa leads the subjects towards goodness and brings happiness.

V. This group is called "Kuwasa" (power) and serves as the implementers of decisions from the "Wisesa" group. Their symbol is a seven-pointed star, representing the shadow of aspirations along with the four elements of the human body. They carry out specific powers as a result of what is perceived by the senses (Wisesa). This group serves as the enforcers of decisions and tends to cause destruction.

VI. This group is called "Dana" (conveyors) and is symbolized by an eight-pointed star, representing the shadow of the four desires, each with two opposing polarities, good and bad. The "Dana" dewa are subordinates of the "Kuwasa" group who act on behalf of the "Wisesa" and carry out the bad aspects. However, in line with that, the "Dana" dewa also act as the executors of the "Hayu" group, bringing forth the good aspects. Thus, commands containing something good come from the "Luhur" to the "Duta," then to the "Hayu," and finally fall to the "Dana." Commands of punishment and other negative aspects come from the "Luhur" to the "Duta," then to the "Wisesa" and "Kuwasa," and also eventually fall to the "Dana." This group leads and teaches all the lesser dewa in their societal order.

VII. This final group is the largest and represents the common people among the dewa, called "Pada" (closure, point). They are symbolized by statues, depicting the largest and most materialistic group among the dewa.

CONTACT WITH HUMANS,

contact between human and the dewa is possible if initiated by the dewa themselves. Humans cannot enter or investigate the world of dewa on their own abilities, unless guided by Suksma Sejati (True Essence). The dewa who often interact with humans include the "Dana" and "Pada" groups. With their abilities or kemayan, they can communicate with humans through aspirations. They can enchant any desired shadows within human aspirations. They seem to have control over aspirations. Humans can be influenced by these thought shadows because the shadows align with their personal expectations or directly affect their executive tools. This is because humans are accustomed to governing their physical bodies with the shadows of their aspirations. The entry point is located between the two eyes on the forehead (Compare with "Hot geheim van de gouden bloem" about the basic understanding of Tao, page 41).

The sovereignty of the dewa causes them, apart from feeling all-powerful, to also desire worship. The presence of relatively high-ranking dewa near humans is perceived by humans as feeling superior, not being subordinate to anyone.

This absolute sovereignty consciousness, through induction, strengthens the sovereignty of the ego of aspirations (humans), and the dewa seeks to snatch these aspirations from the emanating alignment power of Rasa Jati (Essence of Being), which can lead to the destruction of belief in Tripurusa. Humans who experience this may feel displaced and become anxious, eventually leading to insanity.

If humans, in their devotion to Suksma Sejati (True Essence), form shadows of what Suksma Sejati looks like or the level of Suksma Sejati, it can happen that a dewa reveals themselves in the aspirations of that human, precisely in the form of those shadows. This easily captivates the human, making them believe that they have achieved their desires and therefore offer their devotion to that dewa. Because of this, humans are forbidden to create shadows of Tripurusa and its state in their devotions and worship, and the first prohibition is to never worship anyone other than Suksma Kawekas.

In the Old Testament, it is written in the "Ten Commandments" (Exodus 20): 3. "You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol or worship any other gods of the heavens, the earth, or the waters below."

The possession of humans by the dewa can occur willingly or forcibly. Willingly, if the human indeed shows their devotion to the dewa, forcibly if they do not. Immerging oneself in fantasies and daydreams is like providing a comfortable seat for the dewa. The human then becomes possessed.

In the consciousness of and devotion to Tripurusa, it is realized that the human body is the vehicle of Tripurusa, radiating the Great Power that attracts the dewa. Therefore, the expulsion of a dewa from the human body occurs with the awareness of Suksma Sejati and its Great Power. Individuals influenced by the dewa avoid association with those who are truly devoted to Suksma Sejati and distance themselves from the teachings of Suksma Sejati. These individuals receive the teachings of the dewa through whispers in their ears or as visible forms perceived by subtle vision. The presence of a dewa can be known by humans through a distinct scent or certain feelings.

The dewa make efforts to persuade humans to worship them. In return, they offer something that people greatly desire, such as skills that others do not possess, the ability to heal, clairvoyance (knowing hidden conditions and future events), or mastery over the physical body. However, these abilities are not true power; humans are merely repeating the whispers of the dewa or what they have shown. The same applies to other capacities. Humans are used by the dewa as puppets. Once the connection between humans and the dewa has been established, the dewa can be summoned at any time through specific mantras or ceremonies (each dewa has its own key), and the human serves as an intermediary for the dewa. During this time, the person may remain conscious or lose consciousness. While the dewa is within the person, they will feel all-powerful and not be subordinate to anyone. The dewa uses the person's executive tools to manifest themselves. They are always perceived as a foreign body within the person's personality. During possession, the person has no power. All initiative has been taken away from them. Even after the possession is over, the atmosphere of dead initiative still lingers for a while. If this performance happens frequently, the person's aspirations can be split, making them easily susceptible to suggestion. What appears is a false intelligence because the person is simply repeating what the dewa whispers to them.

So the way the influence of the God works is in two forms:

1. From a distance, where there is only contact through the five senses,
2. By occupying and taking over the mind.

Following the Dewa, especially a high-level Dewa, demands a way of life that is not different from worshiping Suksma Kawekas. There, one can find worship with total surrender, rigorous self-discipline, and a way of life that distances oneself from worldly matters, where virtue is essential.

If that's the case, where is the difference?

The difference lies in the orientation of the self (Aku) and the feelings experienced. The orientation in worshiping the Dewa is external to oneself, whereas in worshiping Suksma Kawekas, the orientation is deep within, independent of any external object. The external orientation limits the human encounter with the Dewa to the level of senses.

Entering Rahsa Jati is not an experience of sensory feelings. In fact, the messages from Suksma Sejati, in the form of inspiration or revelation, are not sensory in nature.

The consciousness of the self (Aku) remains present in worshiping the Dewa. In fact, it is even strengthened in the encounter with the authority of Dewa.

The consciousness of the human self (Aku) disappears in its Liberation, and in its place, the human acquires a higher center, which has integrative power, namely Tripurusa.

The Dewa is always perceived as an alien entity within the human body that obstructs and disrupts the harmony of all functions.

The manifestation of Suksma Sejati results in a metamorphosis of the entire personality, creating harmony between the vital centers and enhancing their individual capacities to the maximum point. In the encounter with the Dewa, the human feels himself as the "highest self" to assert his sovereignty. Being united with Suksma Sejati is not accompanied by bodily sensations at that moment; the mind is still and focused in worship.

The messages from the Dewa are apprehended with the senses, granting the human special abilities that are temporary, as if borrowed from the Dewa.

The inspiration or revelation comes from Tripurusa as an essential part of human nature, and thus, it is a development of its own capability. Through worship to Dewa, humans humble their position, as fundamentally, humans possess higher power, and the essence of humans is Life itself, which has created the gods.

Humans elevate their position through devotion to Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati, becoming a personalized Personality.

To understand the subsequent consequences of human worship to the gods, we need to first examine the perspective on the afterlife, as presented in this Indonesian worldview.

## BAB VIII TENTANG HIDUP SESUDAH MATI. (1)

Death is considered a transition to another world. Becoming "lain" (other) entails various aspects. Death is a unique opportunity in a person's life to shift their center of gravity wholly and permanently towards Tripurusa. During the moments of dying, it is as if the entrance to Rahsa Jati opens wide. The "I" simply enters. In other words, Suksma Sejati calls humans back to their original existence. Therefore, death is a special chance to attain Liberation, to free oneself from the gross and subtle physical bodies, both of which return to matter. Human consciousness returns to the immaterial Life.

If death comes and a person has not freed themselves from the tendency to bind to the material, then that opportunity will be lost. In this case, what happens is merely the separation of the subtle physical body from the gross physical body. The gross physical body gradually decomposes, and its constituent elements return to their original form.

The subtle physical body remains and continues the deceased person's life in a different condition.

All vital centers are still present. The gross senses, as the bridge connecting personality and the external world, no longer exist. The external world, which served as a factor to gather necessary experiences for the process of Liberation, has also been detached. This means that now humans can only rely on themselves and what is within themselves. Interpsychic life continues as before, with thoughts appearing and disappearing, desires, cravings, and willpower constantly arising, and feelings changing just like before death.

If during their lifetime before death, a person never created order and direction in their inner life and never attempted to find the path to their Rahsa Jati by penetrating the chaos resulting from the functions of their vital centers, then after death, they will be even more powerless than before.

They become mere playthings of their thoughts, feelings, and desires. In such a state, they derive no benefit from the external world and the gross physical body.

Firstly, in the gross material world, which is perceptible to the senses and with which we interact through the senses, we can find individuals and situations that aid in our process of Liberation, which is an essential development of human existence as an individual. The influence-interaction between the external world and humans forms the basis for gaining experiences. Encounters with the external world allow for improvements in our personality and provide beneficial examples that we can observe with our senses to refresh our inner soul in our hearts.

Moreover, the satisfaction of our desires is crucial for our life's journey, to eliminate tension and neutralize the emotions accompanying that tension, which arise due to the continuous operation of desires, further strengthened by the mind's fantasies.

In the external world, there are objects available to release obligatory feelings, responsibilities, love, and other emotions.

Subjectifying the objects in the external world, establishing a subjective relationship between oneself and the external world, reduces the burden of accumulated affect. It is as if the burden is shared between oneself and the external world. Conversely, desubjectifying it means placing the burden entirely upon oneself. One stands alone. Subjectifying is a sign of weakness, desubjectifying is a sign of spiritual development.

People who are far more experienced than us in the process of Liberation, and even those who have achieved Liberation, can be present with us in the material world and help us organize and align our personality. In short, the physical life facilitates the path to reach Tripurusa.

This material world is referred to as the world of senses and space (eintutelijk ruimtelijk) by K. Jaspers. In the state after death, the structural and functional isolation from the world of senses and space becomes a reality. In such a state, humans become entirely autistic and cannot establish normal connections with the external world. Furthermore, there, only the spirits of those who could not follow the call of Suksma Sejati remain. Even if they can interact with each other, they cannot help one another. These spirits believe and feel as if they are still alive as they were before. However, now there are no objects from the external world to satisfy their desires, cravings, and emotions. Their thoughts and feelings become realities for them, but they cannot provide satisfaction, and thus, they continually experience disappointment, each time their thoughts and feelings disappear. For instance, they may feel thirsty, but they cannot drink, and this thirst continues to torment them until it naturally fades away, replaced by other feelings. Perhaps they feel hot without any way to seek shelter or they long for their families without the possibility of meeting them, as their families do not respond to their calls or presence. The constant change of unfulfillable desires and emotions that fade away by themselves is indeed tormenting. This torment continues until they eventually seek resolution and liberation within themselves, through surrendering to Suksma Kawekas. It is at that moment that they are liberated.

The world in which they wander in their subtle bodies is called the dark world or the realm of the disbelievers. This period is one of suffering, sadness, and disappointment. These individuals live in a world of their own imaginations, which they perceive as genuinely material. In this world, which is nothing more than the continuation of their intrapsychic life in the subtle body, they are compelled to seek resolution within themselves. The faster they find this resolution, the sooner they will leave the realm of the disbelievers. The play of fantasies, feelings, and desires already took place in the gross physical life as well.

So even at that time, humans truly experience a taste of the realm of disbelievers, but before death, there is an external world to release all tensions and emotions, to fulfill desires, and to practice finding their way through their deepest heart and soul. Depending on how they lived in their physical body before, whether they fall into the realm of disbelievers or not, and how long they will stay there.

The human tendency to attach to worldly matters causes them, at the moment of death, to be unaware of their inner obligations. If they cannot detach themselves from worldly matters at the right time, then the preserved world within their soul will go with them, and this is what prevents them from detaching from their subtle body. In the realm of disbelievers, this body does not require material sustenance nor is it bound by age. However, it can be left behind at any time if desired.

If the Rahsa Jati has been rediscovered, then this subtle body is shed, just like one discards old clothes. This happens as in panembah in the gross physical life when a person enters the atmosphere of Rahsa Jati and detaches themselves from bodily existence. The difference is that in this last event, the life of the self (AKU) returns to the same physical body when the panembah is complete.

In the realm of disbelievers, the subtle body is left behind forever since entering Rahsa Jati. At this stage, it is as if the human is weighed and evaluated. If there are still tendencies to attach to worldly matters, then the personality will be reborn into the world. Before being reborn, the personality recalls its Syahadat, and it knows the fate that awaits it in the upcoming life. At this stage, the personality can no longer resist and would prefer to stay in the atmosphere of Rahsa Jati, but it is soon born in the next reincarnation. It is reborn as a human to complete its process of Liberation. In this way, humans get seven opportunities to live in the world with a gross physical body to achieve their Liberation. At each subsequent opportunity, their realm of disbelievers becomes darker, and their subtle body becomes more refined. If after their seventh and final life they still fall into the realm of disbelievers, this individual has strayed so far from the path of Suksma Sejati that it becomes almost impossible for them to recall Suksma Sejati. Their Liberation occurs in the eighth reincarnation, according to the book "Sangkan Paran" by Soenarto et al., as a stillborn baby or one who dies shortly after birth, or they are born as a large animal to atone for their sins when they lived as a human, and acted like an animal.

As mentioned above, humans have tasted the realm of disbelievers during their life in this gross physical body, when they are tormented by desires, thoughts, and certain emotions. However, in such a state, humans are not autistic, and they can fulfill their desires, thoughts, and emotions. In panembah, humans strive hard to break through these desires, thoughts, and emotions to reach Rahsa Jati. During panembah, humans immerse their consciousness into the world without senses within their intrapsychic life. There, they find everything they have experienced. Immersing oneself in this non-sensory experience is not only about observing what is available but also aims to achieve Rahsa Jati and get closer to Suksma Sejati.

To achieve this goal, humans must neutralize the personal value attached to what is available by desubjectifying it. To do this, it requires an attitude towards all psychic aspects, including oneself, as emphasized by Pancasila.

Temen (honesty) provides the courage to look at oneself in realistic proportions, regardless of the future evaluation, whether it is good or of no value at all. Narima (acceptance) and sabar (patience) are necessary to accept the self-evaluation without haste and to persist in efforts to achieve desires. Meanwhile, rela (willingness) is the readiness to release the subjectively valued aspects from the accumulation of experiences, allowing for desubjectivization. Budiluhur (nobility) is a quality as a background, an example, and a conscience that contains a hope: a possibility of existence, as Carp expressed, which can indeed be achieved. Budiluhur leads us to the level of Suksma Sejati. If, during a panembah, we succeed in uniting with Suksma Sejati, we always find that we fall back to the previous level. Initially, we cannot sustain the state of Suksma Sejati for long because there are still tendencies to attach to the world that is attached to us. We have not been purified enough. This phenomenon has also been observed in the realm of disbelievers. If humans successfully shed their autism through themselves, they are seemingly thrown back into the world if they are still impure, but now they do not fall back into the realm of disbelievers. Instead, they obtain a complete subtle body by being reborn as a baby.

The devotion to Suksma Kawekas through Suksma Sejati and the significance of panembah are crucial aspects in the life of the Indonesian candramanusia. However, humans do not always demonstrate their devotion to the Life that touches the core of their being, the point where the inner world and the outer world are connected within themselves. Instead, they allow their happiness to depend on external directions that are bound by space and time. For those who live in this manner, death holds a different meaning, and eventually, they will be compelled to learn to manembah as well because of their autistic existence in the realm of disbelievers.

The gods, apart from their involvement in human family worship, also strengthen the sovereignty of the human self (AKU) and gradually release the bound connection between rahsa jati and the vital centers within the subtle body. The penetration of angan-angan (mind projections) or the retraction of angan-angan by Tripurusa, or the non-use of angan-angan (all expressions for the same phenomenon) becomes quite challenging while family worship continues to take place.

In worshiping a deity, often strict purification from worldliness is required. The higher the deity worshipped, the more intense the devotion and the greater the willingness to sacrifice in the material realm and be bound by it. Consequently, humans, as spiritual beings, live on a thin layer of their subtle body (jasmani-halusnya) close to their celestial realm. For individuals like this, death means going to the realm of the deity. In the realm of disbelievers (alam kafiruna), they remain connected to their deity through lingering mind projections (angan-angannya), and purification continues as part of their devotion to the deity. The more refined their subtle body becomes, the higher their position in the realm of the deity, but their soul grows darker from the perspective of Suksma Sejati. The path back to Suksma Sejati becomes nearly impossible. People like this remain in an autistic state, occasionally being penetrated by contact with their deity, but this contact does not provide sufficient answers to overcome the ever-changing play of desires, feelings, and memories that constantly lead to disappointment. They can reside for thousands of years in the realm of disbelievers, and their deity prevents them from turning their direction and devoting themselves to Suksma Kawekas. Thus, as an exception, they may be reborn to live again in the gross physical body, where purification and impurity can coexist.

In this life, they can help accumulate experiences to come closer to Suksma Sejati and experience it consciously. They can even move in and out of Rahsa Jati with the same body, dedicated to serving humanity.

The power of a deity often attracts and blinds human eyes, causing them to forget their Sacred Origin. Essentially, the same power is also present within the subtle body of humans, known as Bayu Sejati. The unbalanced gross physical body hinders the development of this Bayu Sejati. However, in the state of Suksma Sejati, humans can use the same power. In Liberation, the potential of Bayu Sejati is released unconditionally, leading to a state of existence previously unknown, but what arises is a Consciousness, sovereign and omnipotent, independent of place and time.

This is the HEAVEN in Indonesian candramanusia.

### CHAPTER IX ABOUT KARMA

Karma is an aspect of Suksma Kawekas that governs all life bound by matter, as a law of justice that determines that every action will be reflected. The term "action" here refers not only to physical activities of the physical body but also to every movement emanating from the centers of vitality: Rahsa Jati, mind, feeling, and desire. All qualities of these outgoing movements are subject to this law, including their qualities, quantities, forms, directions, and all attributes bound by space and time.

What lies beyond the power of Karma is the immaterial Life, which is still and silent. As the Buddha said, "Everything that happens, is born, or is made, contains within itself the ethical responsibility for its destruction." "Happening" implies that it will return to its original existence. "Action" enters the existence of space and time, implying that it will eventually depart from it.

According to the history of the universe as explained in this Indonesian cosmology (Gumelaring Dumadi, book III of Sasangka Jati), from the immaterial and silent Life, the Dynamic is born as the executor of the Will contained within the Silence. There is a Will to release the Holy Spirit as a spark from the Silence, but this Will postpones its execution, awaiting the existence of material garments as vessels for the sacrificial spark emanating from itself.

To create these vessels, the Dynamic, as the Executor of the Static, brings forth the four elements in sequence: ether (atmosphere), fire, water, and earth, each possessing its own inherent power. With the birth of the atmosphere, time and space are also born. Everything born after the element of atmosphere and bound by matter can be measured by the dimensions of space and time. These four elements, with their respective powers, interact with one another under the guidance of wise planning, leading to the gradual formation of the universe. Once the vessels are ready, their contents come forth: humans, gods, animals, and plants.

The essence within a human is Tripurusa, the immaterial life in three degrees, descending into matter with all its consequences. At that moment, the Law of Karma begins to apply to it. Since Tripurusa is considered as the point of stillness, the transfer of the center of life from the immaterial to the material is a concrete action that must, at some point, return to its stillness. This attachment to matter must eventually be dissolved through Liberation.

In Carp's book "Problemen yan het Mene-zijn" on page 81, it is clearly explained that "at some point Liberation will come."

All activities of the mind, feeling, and desire are the result of the transfer of the center of life to the physical body, choosing a life that contains possibilities of existence and possibilities of action that are opposite (polar). These polarities do not exist within Tripurusa.

The three vital centers show polarity. The mind is directed in concentration and abstraction. Illumination by the mind creates a dark field outside the illuminated field. Attention limits and automatically creates a part outside of that attention. The formation of consciousness is accompanied by the occurrence of unconsciousness.

The climate of Tripurusa, known as Rahsa Jati, is not what we commonly refer to as consciousness or unconsciousness, but rather a state between the two, which contains both within it.

The consciousness of Tripurusa does not expel ordinary consciousness but transcends both consciousness and unconsciousness. A liberated human also sleeps, but remains conscious during sleep. They die, but their death does not change anything in their Consciousness. If described in terms of the Law of Karma, this human is already beyond the Law of Karma; their life is no longer governed by the law of cause and effect.

The sovereignty of the mind is balanced by its submissiveness, the activity of power as a regulator of the physical body is balanced by surrendering powerlessness, a result of their passive attitude towards Tripurusa.

Desire also possesses its polar qualities. Lawamah has two conflicting attributes that allow for sublimation. Furthermore, Lawamah is the opposite pole of mutmainah.

If we consider the vital centers as sources of energy, as proposed by Jung, then the energies that are emitted will eventually return to their original source, with all their qualities. One might be tempted to think of fixed labor energy and thus consider the laws of natural sciences to apply to life bound by matter.

The opposing polar aspects of one center can balance each other, but the experiences that have been undergone will never be eradicated. If the two opposing polar aspects of one center are likened to white ink and black ink placed in one container, then the color of the ink is determined by the proportion of these two qualities. If there is only a little black and a lot of white, then at some point, we may not see the black anymore, but the black ink is still there.

Therefore, in this Law of Karma, there is a force of influence, in the sense of accumulation and mitigation.

Because of mitigation and accumulation, the actions reflected back to us by Karma can be perceived as either heavier or lighter.

The background at the time of Karma's arrival is also a crucial factor. For instance, if someone had once struck another person's head with an iron blow, then according to Karma, they will also receive a blow to their head at some point. How this blow will come to them depends on the nature of their attitude and behavior during the time between when they delivered the blow and when they receive Karma. If during that time, their behavior was based on the Consciousness of Suksma Sejati, living according to Trisila and Pancasila, then their life has balanced, in the sense of redeeming their past actions. As a result, they may only receive a light tap on their head. This tap may not come from the person they struck before, but from a friend or relative as a playful gesture, or they may receive a tap on their head in a drama with the actor using a cardboard box. In this way, Karma has been fulfilled. Mitigation or accumulation and changes in their circumstances lead the person to accept and experience their fate as either a blessing or a punishment. Their attitude towards life depends on their relationship at that time with Tripurusa and the material world.

Karma is not only determined by the activities of various vital centers and the activities of the entire personality, but the soul's climate formed by these centers is also a contributing factor that helps determine the fate awaiting the individual.

When Karma comes to humans, it is contained within the wisdom of Suksma Sejati as the True Leader and Teacher. The psychic condition at that time is always the best condition to awaken or stimulate the Consciousness of Tripurusa. Seen from this standpoint, the Law of Karma is also the "eternal principle" (an unchanging law that applies forever), a phenomenon of the Ultimate Justice, Compassion, and Forgiveness of Suksma Kawekas, which guides us through physical and spiritual experiences to deduce its core meaning, which can then be used as a compass to attain the essence of life. Thus, it has a pedagogical purpose (to educate). For a traveler of life whose aim is to attain the essence of life and to see the possibility of becoming one with Suksma Sejati and being liberated from the Law of Karma, there is no more profit or loss. Everything is an experience, and what exists are only actions and attitudes that bind one to a life bound by materialism or lead one to Liberation. The polarity remains in its focus, whether forever within Tripurusa or within the physical body. If the focus is permanently placed within the Immateriial Life, then from there, the physical body is controlled. The actions of the physical body then become manifestations of Suksma Sejati, which govern the Law of Karma. If living in the material world with all its consequences is called "sin" or at least contains the potential for "sin," then the person who has attained Liberation is already free from sin.

Freeing oneself from "sin" means getting closer and closer to the level of Suksma Sejati. For individuals who are already at the threshold of Liberation, the only "sin" is their attachment to the material world, which still contains the possibility of being reborn. The distinction between good and bad has long been abandoned, not only in thought but also in action. This does not mean that individuals at this level mix the application of good and bad and act arbitrarily, but it means that such differentiation is no longer a consideration for their life orientation.

A human being born for the first time is inexperienced in using their mind, feelings, and desires. Their vital functions are not yet grounded in experience, making them susceptible to external factors and the influence of others. The rightness or wrongness of their actions is more influenced by external factors than by their own initiative. All these factors are included in the consideration of Karma, which can provide mitigation in the reflection of their actions.

If we are allowed to compare the Law of Karma to a court trial, then the defendant, witnesses, prosecutor, judge, and executioner of the verdict are their own actions. The justice administered by the Law of Karma is absolute and individual.

Furthermore, in the same book "Sangkan Paran," it is written that if in the first incarnation one does not attain Liberation and is born for a second life after experiencing the realm of kafiruna, then in this second life, there is Karma that has not been fulfilled, and its realization may be expected later.

In the second and subsequent lives, experiences accumulate, and there is more initiative and personal responsibility. Both these factors are taken into account in their Karma and determine when Karma will come to them. The justice of Suksma Kawekas takes into account personal accountability, and humans are given ample opportunities to improve themselves. Generally, it can be said that the less personal responsibility one has, the lighter their Karma, and it comes quickly after their actions, establishing the connection between their faults and their consequences. As one's incarnations progress, personal responsibilities increase, Karma becomes heavier, and it takes longer to arrive after their actions, providing an opportunity for self-improvement.

The seven incarnations form a continuous line in terms of the consciousness of the self (I). Perhaps the subtle body remains the same throughout these successive lives, whether alongside a gross physical body or alone within the realm of kafiruna.

As long as there is a physical body, classifications based on existing differences can be made, allowing the human community to be divided into various classes or levels. Humanity can be divided based on the manifestation of vital centers, and further divisions can be made based on the comparison of qualities and capacities. For instance, there could be classes of the angan-angan type with hierarchical interrelated subdivisions, or classes of the nafsu type with further detailed classifications, and so on.

People can create divisions based on where the center of their life's focus lies—whether in the external world or the internal world, as Jung did in his extrovert and introvert typologies. 

As a starting point, all typologies can be accepted, and all these different types can serve as a basis from which each individual can free themselves from the bondage of material existence.

The Law of Karma also determines which social group an individual will be born into in their future reincarnations.

It is justified to question ourselves whether liberation, as described here, is the true purpose of life. As humans who have not achieved Liberation, we cannot provide a comprehensive answer. However, we can test the Truth of Tripurusa through our own experiences by following a way of life that fosters conditions conducive to intuition and revelation. Alternatively, one can choose the path towards the gods. Regardless of the choice made, ultimately, humans are only responsible for themselves.

Let us allow our thoughts to move freely for a while.

If it is true that the purpose of life is Liberation, then over time, this goal will become clearer. Humanity and societies will change as they develop, as their vital centers continue to grow. Differentiation into beings dominated by nafsu, pangrasa, angan-angan, and Rahsa Jati may emerge, each forming somewhat separate societies. Just as there is specialization in character traits, there may also be specialization in types of humans based on their vital centers. In further development, there may remain two major groups. First, a large group of individuals experiencing Rahsa Jati as their center, and second, a large group of individuals following their Rahsa Jati and solely developing their AKU-materii (Bayu Sejati) as the sovereign ruler over the physical body, exploiting the centers of bodily energy (perhaps even those centers that have not been developed until now). It is very possible, merely as a suggestion, that these two large groups may eventually confront each other.

If the development of humanity has progressed to the point where only two differentiations remain, namely the group that manifests Tripurusa within themselves and the opposite group that develops the sovereignty of their ego to its pinnacle, then the path to reach Tripurusa is not a circular one starting with Trisila and Pancasila. Instead, it is sufficient to remind oneself of the sovereignty of life over oneself to enter into the first group. These two contrasting types are surprisingly standing very close to each other.

In a stage of human development like this, it is conceivable that all humans are no longer influenced by material needs. They may have already mastered their nafsu, rendering angan-angan inoperative.

The uncontrolled sovereignty of the ego, which recognizes nothing above itself, can rightfully and easily form an alliance with the highest gods, and perhaps even replace the gods in the shadow government of the world under the guise of a brotherhood that encompasses the entire world.

The replacement of gods can indeed happen because these gods are limited by their constituent elements, as they consist only of anasur. Consequently, if we continue with this line of thought, which can also be called fantasy, there will be beings with subtle material bodies living very close to the world of the anasir api. And when, at some point, karma as the final act comes, the justice of Suksma Kawekas towards humanity will descend, and a balance sheet must be made of all the contrasting polar aspects of all actors within ourselves as beings, both material and spiritual. At that moment, in my opinion, it is crucial whether someone, from an immaterial perspective, is bankrupt or not. Let me be conscious again; in the end, the shadows of thoughts do not hold significance, only Suksma Kawekas, personally contains and embodies THE TRUTH.

## SUMMARY 

The need is felt to have "candramanusia" and "candradunia" as the starting point and basis for a way of life, from which one can derive psycho-prophylaxis and psychotherapy. We choose and highlight "candramanusia" and "candradunia" of Soenarto Mertowardojo here, for the following reasons:

1. This Candra includes much more comprehensive material for a perfect "candramanusia" and "candradunia," which originates from a single source.

2. Candrajiwa represents the greatest common denominator of a complete "candramanusia" compared to various "candramanusia" and "candradunia" existing in Indonesia.

3. This Candra reveals genuine differences between "candramanusia" that develop from the essence of humanity (het Zelf) as their goal and "candramanusia" that direct themselves towards external powers and factors beyond the self (het Zelf).

4. This Candra demonstrates the essence of human existence, which contains the potential for merging into the Transcendent Absolute.

5. It offers the possibility of extracting psychotherapy from it.

6. This Candra can brilliantly compete with Freud, Adler, and Jung's works on "candramanusia" and "candradunia."

7. This Candra reveals the potentials within humans that hold both theoretical and practical significance for the future.

This Candra is presented in two ways: In Part I, it is explained in its orthodox form, in chapters titled "De weg" (The Path), "Over het leven na de dood" (On Life after Death), and "Over Karma" (On Karma). In Part II, this Candra is described using the terminologies of psychology.

To gain a better understanding of the Indonesian Candrajiwa, schemas from the four systems are presented in the chapter "Vergelijkende beschouwingen over de plaats van het IK in de systemen van Freud, Adler en Jung en het Indonesisch menbeeld" (Comparative Considerations on the Position of the Self in the Systems of Freud, Adler, Jung, and the Indonesian Worldview) (Part II, Chapter III).

For those who are oriented towards the Western perspective, the schema of the self in Freud, Adler, and Jung's systems serves as a foothold to comprehend the Indonesian "candramanusia" and "candradunia."

In the Indonesian "candramanusia," in addition to the functions of creation, feeling, and will, there is also the fourth function, which represents the true center of the human. This fourth function is not only the center of potentiality but also provides a perspective to enter the Transcendent Absolute (transcendent being-possibility). Through this fourth function, all conscious and unconscious mechanisms within the human psyche can be experienced. This fourth function is called the immaterial center, as it also serves as the gateway to the Transcendent Absolute.

Eternity is the goal of humanity and human existence. Because the Indonesian worldview is rooted in the belief that immaterial Life is the beginning and original source of all Life, achieving Eternity also means returning to the original Source of all Life.

This immaterial Life consists of three distinct phases. The first phase is Suksma Kawekas, which is a static and unmoving phase of Life. In parallel with it, the second phase occurs, which is Suksma Sejati, a dynamic phase of Life that moves and manifests the boundless power of Suksma Kawekas. The third phase is the Holy Spirit, which is a spark of Suksma Sejati and represents the true soul of humanity. The Triune: Suksma Kawekas - Suksma Sejati - Holy Spirit is the immaterial center within every human being and is called Tripurusa. Suksma Sejati is also known as the Eternal Messenger of Suksma Kawekas and the son of Sang Rama.

For the Holy Spirit, Suksma Sejati is the True Warrior, Teacher, and Leader, the Word, the Shepherd, and so on.

The gross physical body possesses inherent opposing powers. These powers are desires and they are immanent forces, the elements that shape the gross physical body. Some are called egoistic and egocentripetal desires, while others are known as social and suprasocial desires (Carp) that are egocentrifugal in nature.

Because Tripurusa resides within the gross physical body, its shadow is formed. This shadow of Tripurusa acts as the leader of these desires, and we call this the intellectual ability or "logos" of humans. Because Tripurusa has three facets, "logos" also consists of three facets, namely:

1. that functions to create images (cipta)
2. that functions associatively (nalar)
3. that functions to encompass, understand, and transcend (pangerti)

The most important characteristic of this "logos" is its sovereignty as a reflection of the absolute power of Tripurusa. This reflection of Tripurusa gives rise to the consciousness of the self, which envelops its other functions. This self-consciousness gives birth to personality.

So, within humans, there are elements that are material as well as immaterial. The material elements contain biological, instinctual, and collective characteristics. The immaterial elements are spiritual, non-instinctual, and collectively conscious. Among them is the consciousness of the self or the individual, which contains individual conscious and subconscious characteristics, as well as instinctual and non-instinctual individual characteristics.

Humanity is considered to evolve from the physical to the spiritual, from instinctual to non-instinctual, and from collective unconsciousness to collective consciousness. This development occurs through the consciousness of the self, which is individual in nature. In ordinary humans (most humans), the consciousness of the non-instinctual immaterial Life is buried due to the dominance of instinctual life. The collective consciousness is buried due to the dominance of collective unconsciousness.

Due to the personality of the AKU (Self), there seems to be a transitional phase between the characteristics of the physical and the spiritual, between instinctual and non-instinctual, and between collective unconsciousness and collective consciousness. Therefore, the task of the AKU is gradually to eliminate the instinctual nature of the physical body so that the non-instinctual spiritual qualities can emerge. This will lead to a shift towards collective consciousness. In this development, the AKU will be suppressed and ultimately merge into collective consciousness. The transition to this non-instinctual collective consciousness occurs by freeing oneself from the instinctual collective unconsciousness. With the suppression of the AKU, individual subconsciousness disappears, while individual consciousness becomes more collective.

The AKU will gradually eliminate the instinctual nature of the physical body so that the non-instinctual spiritual qualities can emerge. This will lead to a shift towards collective consciousness. In this development, the AKU will be suppressed and ultimately merge into collective consciousness. The transition to this non-instinctual collective consciousness occurs by freeing oneself from the instinctual collective unconsciousness. With the suppression of the AKU, individual subconsciousness disappears, while individual consciousness becomes more collective.

This principle forms the basis of psycho-prophylaxis, psychotherapy, and psycho-hygiene in Indonesia.

The merging of the consciousness of the AKU into collective consciousness is called Pamudaran. In Pamudaran, the consciousness of the AKU disappears, leading to significant changes in the human soul. The conflict between desires and fantasies vanishes. Fantasies no longer have sovereignty, as the physical qualities surrender to the spiritual, transforming a life full of instincts into one without instincts, while individual personality merges into collective consciousness.

Desires remain as vital forces and are no longer part of the cognitive activities of individuals who have reached Pamudaran.

As individual consciousness approaches collective consciousness, there are sometimes temporary meetings between the two, as if individual consciousness experiences the omnipotence of collective consciousness. This is what is called intuition or revelation.

On the other hand, what is instinctual (Carp) is the extraordinary potential or ability of humans, such as telepathy, precognition, and so on. However, these abilities do not surpass the individual AKU. They are abilities that can be developed by the AKU by uniting all the powers it possesses.

During childhood, when emotions and intelligence are not yet fully developed, the emphasis is on desires. As one becomes an adult, the emphasis shifts to feelings or fantasies, usually in men it is on fantasies, while in women it is on feelings. If the emphasis is on fantasies, then feelings are in the background, and vice versa, fantasies will appear vague in the background if women emphasize their feelings. What remains in the background, according to Jung, is called anima or animus.

In order to guide one's life towards Pamudaran, it is advisable for humans to let their social and suprasocial desires dominate the egocentripetal desires. The latter desires are transformed into desires that incline humans to overcome physical deficiencies and suffering. The shift in emphasis to egocentrifugal desires is achieved through a simple way of life and practicing virtues such as compassion and love for all living beings. Simplicity can be achieved through tapa brata. This transformation in the soul is the mechanism of sublimation.

Another important aspect of the path towards Pamudaran is shifting the emphasis of fantasies over feelings to the center of the Immaterial. This is achieved through panembah in its broadest sense. In relation to this, simplicity of life and panembah are important factors in Indonesian candramanusia and candradunia.

What changes in the process of Pamudaran is consciousness. Human consciousness becomes increasingly limited by the AKU (Self). Gradually, the individual's personality diminishes (onpersoonlijk) and after "wudar" becomes absolute, unlimited, and impersonal. Those who have reached Pamudaran experience a consciousness that exists in every living being and is no longer restricted by time and space. There is no longer a small world and a big world. There are no more psychological processes. The individual who has "wudar" becomes the Ultimate Unity Divider and the Multiplicity of the Smallest Unity at the same time. Consciousness at the level of Pamudaran is the end point of the development of feelings, fantasies, and abilities. These three functions unite in Pamudaran and then disappear. The level of Pamudaran, known as the level of True Suksma, can be achieved by every human being.

In Western psychological systems, only Jung shows the existence of further development of the human soul. The process called Pamudaran in Indonesian candramanusia is referred to by Jung as "werden zur Persönlichkeit, Selbstverwirklichung," Verselbstung, or Individuationsprozess.

For Freud, the endpoint is death. For Adler, the ideal is to live according to the rules of society (social life) without the possibility of the AKU (Self) merging into that social life.

Therapy based on Indonesian candramanusia and candradunia aims to awaken the patient's willingness to direct their attitude towards the immaterial Center (True Nature) within themselves.
